            <Search>ASSEMBLYING STAGES OF AMT105 TESTER  The following parts are used to assemble the AMT105 relay
                tester. Four wires with Four 2 pin female Phoenix connectors / Four wires with 4 pin female Phoenix
                connectors / Current connectors / Voltage connectors
                / Ribbon cables / Neutrik board Back panel Front panel / Switching module Complete side of switching
                module / Incomplete side of switching module / Amplifier module Complete side of amplifier module /
                Incomplete side of amplifier module
                / Case / To assemble the device, you must first install the back panel on the case. Stand the case in
                front of you, in a way that the power socket is on your right side. Connect one of the earth wires to
                the power socket and the other
                one to the earth socket. / / Placing the amplifier module in the case The amplifier module is placed
                into the case where the racks are less spaced opposite to the input power socket. / Position of
                amplifier module inside the case The complete
                side of the amplifier goes to the case wall. The edges of the module should be placed inside the 4
                racks. / Connecting the socket of fan to the amplifier module Insert the module up to 5 cm to the end of
                the case, then take the fan wire
                from the back of the Spacer and connect the socket to the amplifier then push the module to the bottom
                of the case. / Note: make sure that the fan wire is not under any modules or inside the fan. Position of
                amplifier module inside the
                case The incomplete side of the switching module the one that only has a command board should be on the
                side of the case’s wall, so that the Ethernet, USB, RS232, Wi-Fi and GPS ports are downward and placed
                in the rear panel. / Connecting
                the socket of fan to the switching module Insert the module up to 5 cm to the end of the case, then take
                the fan wire from the back of the Spacer and connect the socket to the switching module finally push the
                module to the bottom of the
                case. / Complete fitting of the switching module By shaking the GPS port, the switching module must be
                fully placed at the bottom of the case. / Ethernet and USB socket must be 1 to 2 mm away from the back
                of the case. If the socket of
                the Ethernet and USB are stuck, In case ports are stuck shaking them allows them to come out from the
                back panel. / Note: make sure that the fan wire is not under any modules or inside the fan. Installing
                the front panel Before installing
                the front panel, check that the varnished wire connected to the back panel is completely straight.
                Connecting the input power cable varnished tube Connect the two heads of wires that come from the back
                panel to the zero side of the power
                switch on the panel. The guards must be faced outwards so that they can be easily opened. / Connecting
                four 2 pin Phoenix connectors First, connect two 2 pin female Phoenix connectors to the incomplete board
                of the switching modules. Connect
                the other side to the switching modules. / Connecting a 4 pin Phoenix connector Connect one side of the
                corresponding power cord to 1 key and connect the Phoenix side to the incomplete switching switchboard.
                / / / Connecting the Phoenix
                Connectors of the Front Panel First, on the left side, connect the corresponding Phoenixes to the
                amplifier. You should first connect the two 16 pin Phoenixes and then connect the two 5 pin Phoenixes. /

                difference goes over 500 mA, the “Other”
                error should be displayed. In the "Relative" section, this value is specified as a percentage of the
                value specified in the test. In the actual operating mode, the device uses the lowest value among these
                two for the error message. / /
                In the "Binary Input Status" section, it is specified which binary is connected and which binary is not.

                disable them. "Select All Error
                Other": this error is displayed when the device is unable to produce the current and voltage asked by
                the user. The cause for this error can be the voltage outputs' short circuting or the current outputs'
                open-circuting. By opening the
                drop-down of each errors’ fields, any error can be disabled for a number of voltage and current outputs.
                "Select All Error Self": every time before running the test, the device checks its internal hardware to
                determine whether it is capable
                of generating +50V or -50V of voltage and +5A and -5A of current. If there is a problem, the device
                displays a "Self" error. "Error Thermal": this error is displayed when the temperature of the device's
                sensors is increased. Occasionally,
                the thermal sensor of one of the switches has a problem, indicating irrational temperatures such as 800
                degrees. In this case, in the slider of this section, it is possible to deactivate the thermal error to
                continue working with the device.
                "Error Over Current Binary 9": the binary 9 of the device can measure the current up to 500mA. If the
                input current of this binary exceeds this value, this error is displayed. "Select All Error Over Voltage
                Binary": depending on the duration
                specified for them, if their input voltage exceeds the specified limit, the binary inputs of the device
                will display this error. For instance, in the 4.5V mode, if the input voltage of any of the binaries
                exceeds 4.5V, the device will
                display this error. In the "Times For ignoring Over Voltage Binary" field, the maximum time allowed to
                ignore the "Over Voltage" error of the binary is specified. By default, it is set that if the time for
                the "Over Voltage" error is not
                shorter than 100 milliseconds, the device will not display any error about this matter. / This should be
                noted that, since "Thermal Error" and "Error Over Current Binary 9" are among the fatal "Errors" of the
                device, their deactivation
                setting will not be saved by the software and will be disabled each time the software is run, then if
                this "Error" needs to be disabled, the user must do this manually. The "Check RAM" section is used for
                testing the RAM that is used in
                the “AMT”. In the "Repetition" field, the number of times that a series of data are written in the RAM
                and erased is specified. This section can be used in case of uncertainty about the performance of the
                device's RAM. Since the writing
                and reading operations are performed on the RAM multiple times, eventually, if there is a problem in
                this process, the error light on the panel of the device will turn on. / In the "Earth" section, it is
                possible to enable or disable the
                "Earth" error of the device. If the "Enable" option is checked, it is necessary to connect the "Earth"
                cable to perform the test. Otherwise, an “Earth” error will be displayed and the device will stop
                working. This error can be deactivated
                by unchecking the “Enable” option. But, it is vital to note that, doing so during the test can be lethal

            <Search>GENERAL TYPES OF ROOMS Generally, there are two types of testing rooms available on the main page of
                the software. The “VCC” room: this room provides you with a place to perform a series of different
                tests. Also, it is possible to perform
                several tests from different rooms in a continuous manner in this room. / The other rooms including “AMT
                Sequencer”, “AMT Distance”, “AMT Transformer” and “AMT Differential”, have the same main page. The only
                difference is that in these
                rooms, a few features are made hidden or shown according to the needs. For example, in the “Hardware”
                section in the “Sequencer” room, there is an option for “Calibration” but in the same section in the
                “Distance” room, this option is
                not available and has been made hidden. / All necessary features for performing different tests are
                available in the “Sequencer” room. “Table View”, “Detail View” and “Measurement View” are the important
                windows of this page while the
                “Table View” and “Measurement View” are not available in the other rooms. Also, the “Detail View” window
                in this room is different from the “Detail View” in the other rooms like “Distance”. In rooms like
                “Overcurrent”, “Distance” and “Differential”,
                which are also called the “Medium” rooms, the “Table View” and “Measurement View” windows are not
                available but instead, the “Test View” window is available in these rooms. Generally, the “Test View”
                window is the same in all “Medium”
                rooms. In the “Test View”, some options are made hidden or shown according to the needs. For example, in
                the “Differential” room, the “I diff” and “I bias” fields are available, while in the “Distance” room,
                the “[z,Left:0,Top:0,Right:0,Bottom:0,Scale:50%]”
                and “phi” fields are available. Some parts like “Trigger” and “Binary Output” are the same in all rooms
                because changing their parameters was not deemed to be necessary. Those rooms which are used for testing
                the equipment are called “State
                Sequencer” and the windows available in the “Sequencer” rooms are, also, available in these rooms.
                Moreover, the “Instrument View” window, which is not available in the “Sequencer” rooms, is added to
                these rooms. Some windows including
                “Vector View” and “Signal View” are similar in all rooms and have the same structure but it is possible
                that some of their information is made hidden or shown according to the needs.

                entering the information. 1-The information that is entered in the tables. 2-The information that is
                entered in a separate cell where only entering numbers is possible. 3-The information that is entered in
                a separate cell where only entering
                text is possible. The point is that it is not possible to enter any information in those cells which are
                "Read only" in conditions such as "Line-Line" mode. / If you double-click on a cell, the content inside
                the cell becomes highlighted
                and while entering the information, its unit of quantity remains stable. In these cells, there is a
                space between the entered number and its unit which makes a better view for the user. By holding the
                mouse on each cell and clicking on
                it, the minimum and maximum numbers which can be entered in the intended cell are displayed. Close the
                "Measurement View" and "Detail View" windows and open the "Vector View" window. Then, right-click on
                this window and select "Show" in
                the opened list and check the "Line-Line" option so that the linear values are displayed on this window.
                / Now in the "Table View", enter “23.00" for the second phase voltage with zero phase. You can see that
                the value of "VL1-L2" in the
                "Vector View" window is zero. Now, enter "23.0001" for the first phase in the "Table View". Then, you
                can see that in the "VL1-L2" linear voltage field, the number "100µV" is displayed while in the "Table
                View", both first phases show
                the same value of 23.00. The number "23.0001" is in the memory of the software but since it is specified
                in the "Number of Decimal Places Setting" that only four meaningful numbers should be displayed, the
                number "23.00" is being shown
                while the original number is "23.0001" which is stored in the memory of the software. If you
                double-click on the first phase, and after it gets highlighted, press "enter" on your keyboard, this
                time the number "23.00" gets recorded in
                the software and, also, the linear voltage amount changes to zero. / If you enter "23.2568" in the first
                phase, the "VL1-L2" linear voltage field will display the number "256.6mV" while in the "Table View" the
                number "23.26" will be displayed
                which means that, not only according to the "Number of Decimal Places Setting", only four meaningful
                digits of this number are being displayed, but also, this number has been rounded. It is also possible
                to use measurement units while
                initializing. For example, you can enter “10m” instead of the number "0.01". In this case, there is a
                space between "m" and "V" after pressing the "enter" button, the "m" acronym sticks to the quantity unit
                and the "Space" gets removed
                in order to make a better view for the user. In some cells, after entering the intended value, a message
                is displayed saying that the entered value is above the allowed limit. In this case, there are two
                possibilities: / 1-In some cells,
                after clicking on the "OK" option, there is another message displayed saying that if you select the "No"
                option, the entered number will not be recorded in the cell and the previous number will replace the new
                one but if you select the
                "Yes" option, the new number will be recorded and the cell turns red, indicating an error in the
                recorded number. / 2-In some other cells, if the entered number is above the allowed limit, if you click
                on the “OK” option in the displayed
                message, the software will not allow this number to get recorded in the cell and uses the previous
                number instead. / In addition to directly entering a number, it is possible to use mathematical
                expressions and operations to enter a number
                in the software. For example, if you "1/256", which the software will automatically calculate and put
                the result in the cell. Or you can enter a mathematical operation in the cell, like "sin45*sqrt25" which
                is the amount of "sin" in radians.
                The point to note is that it is not possible to enter mathematical operations as something like "11m*1"
                and no measurement units are to be used in mathematical operations. /

        <contant id="Analog_Output_Setting">
            <Search>ANALOG OUTPUT SETTING By clicking on "Hardware Configuration", a new page with the same name opens
                where the settings for voltage and current outputs, binary inputs, and outputs of the device as well as
                some other settings in "Extra Setting"
                are set. In the "Analog Output" tab, the settings for voltage and current outputs, activeness or
                inactiveness of outputs, labeling them and displaying the actual values for the output signals of the
                device are adjusted. / In "Voltage and
                Current Output" sections, the maximum receivable voltage and current from the outputs of the device are
                specified according to their wiring, which the users can use depending on their needs. By selecting any
                of the options, a figure of
                the wiring for receiving the required voltage and current is displayed in a box in the middle of the
                page. For example, by selecting single-phase 300 V, to receive up to 300 V with a 400 mA current, the
                user needs to do the wiring according
                to this figure. In the "Current Output" section, there is some information about wiring. For example, in
                the first wiring, there are 6 32 amp current Outputs. In this case, a maximum of 32 amp with 3 V is fed
                by every phase and up to 5
                amp with 12 V is receivable from the current outputs. / In the "Show Actual Value" column in "Voltage
                Output Signal” and "Current Output Signal" sections, it is possible to activate displaying the "Actual"
                value of output signal in the
                "Signal View" window. To do this, you need to change the value of the cell of your intended signal in
                the "Show Actual Value" from "False" to "True". For example, if the "Show Actual Value" of "VL1-E"
                signal is changed to "True", by running
                the test, it is observed that there are circles on the waveform of its signal. / / In the "Output Label"
                column, it is possible to specify a "Label" for each of the outputs. In addition to the labels in the
                drop-down field, it is possible
                to add new label by typing it. / In the "Output Target" column for each of the outputs a target will be
                specified. In selecting an "Output Target", it is important to note that each of these "Output Target"
                has a meaning. For example,
                if "VL1-E" is selected for the first output of the "voltage output A" and "IL1" for the first output of
                the "current output A", by selecting "Set Mode: Z-I const", the software divides the 2 volts of "VL1-E"
                into 1 amp of "IL1", which
                are the first output of the "voltage output A" and the first output of the "current output A",
                respectively, to simulate phase to ground fault with a 2 ohm fault impedance. Now, if, in the "Hardware
                Configuration" page, "VL1-E" is selected
                for the second output of "voltage output A", in simulating the fault impedance of the previous example,
                the software, again, divides the 2 volts voltage of "VL1-E" into 1 amp current of "IL1", except that
                this time the voltage of "VL1-E"
                and "IL1" is injected from the second output of the "voltage output A" and the first output of the
                "current output A", respectively. Also, it should be noted that if "VL3-E" is selected for the third
                output of the "voltage output A", and
                the same "Output Target" is selected for the single-phase output of the "voltage output B", the third
                output of the "voltage output A" changes to "Not Used" and this "Output Target" is selected for the
                single-phase output of the "voltage
                output B". This means that each of the available "Output Target" can only be selected for a single
                output. / / / / As another example, in the "AMT Distance" Room, the software uses "voltage output A" and
                "current output A" to simulate
                fault impedance. If the user wants to use the "current output B" instead of the "current output A" for
                current injection, they should select "IL1", "IL2" and "IL3" as the "Output Target" for the three
                outputs of the "current output B"
                in the "Hardware Configuration" page. /

            <Search>BINARY INPUT SETTING, PART1 Under the "Binary Input" tab in “Hardware Configuration" window, the
                settings of the 10 binary inputs of the device are set. Binaries 1 to 8 are located at the bottom of the
                device from left to right. Binaries 9
                and 10 are located in the upper right row of the device. Binaries 1 to 8 are of the voltage type. The
                binaries 9 and 10 are used for measuring AC and DC currents with 50micro precision up to 500mA and 240mv
                respectively. / Activating and
                deactivating a “Binary Input”: Activation or deactivation of binaries is determined in the "Binary Input
                Target" column. For example, you can activate binary number 3 by clicking on its relevant field. In this
                case, a list of different
                targets is displayed and you can select one depending on your test's needs. Note that the binary inputs
                of the device may be sensitive to your selected target. While testing the equipment and changing the
                hardware configuration of the
                device, you should note that the label of binary inputs must be selected in accordance with the
                information in the test configuration. By clicking on this field and selecting "Not Used", it is
                possible to deactivate the corresponding "Binary
                Input". It is also possible to use the "N" shortcut to deactivate a "Binary Input". You can activate or
                deactivate the binaries 1 to 8 at the same time by using the square above the binaries' numbers column.
                / / Selecting a “Label” for
                a “Binary Input”: You can select a "Label" for your desired "Binary Input" in the "Binary Input Label"
                column. By default, the "Label" selected in the "Binary Input Target" is listed in this part but the
                user can, also, select a different
                "Label" from the drop-down list or enter a new "Label" in Persian or English. It should be noted that in
                "Report" and binary signal display in "Signal Label", the "View" specified in this section is displayed
                as the label for the signal.
                This also applies to "Analog Output" and "Binary Output" and in the "Report" the "Label" is displayed
                for the desired parameter. / Specifying Binary-Input Type: In the "Binary Input Type" column, the type
                of binary inputs number 1 to 8
                is selected from two generic modes of "Dry" and "Wet", which is by default set as "Dry". In this case,
                there is a 2V DC on the two ends of "Binary Inputs" Zero Mode and by short-circuiting the output
                contacts of the relay, the voltage
                decreases to zero and the digital signal 1 is detected by the binary. / In the "Wet" mode, the binaries
                number 1 to 8 are set to measuring mode. There are three levels for this mode. In the "Wet Max 4.5V"
                level, the "Binary Input" measures
                up to 4.5V with 1mV precision, up to 30V with 3mV precision in the "Wet Max 30V" and up to 188V with
                10mV precision in the "Wet Max 188V" level. When the "Wet" mode is selected for "Binary Input", the
                "Threshold" column is activated. In
                this column, a threshold is specified for "Binary Input" status. For example in the "Wet Max 188V"
                level, if the threshold is set to "50", if the maximum input voltage is less than 50V, digital signal 0
                is detected while with a maximum
                input voltage more than 50V, digital signal 1 is detected. / If the "Binary Input" is used for measuring
                the voltage, it is important to select the maximum level of "Wet" measurement. For example, to measure a
                23V voltage, the binary level
                "Wet Max 30V" must be selected. If “Wet Max 4.5V" is selected, when the voltage exceeds 4.5V, the
                software gives an "Over Voltage Binary" error message and if the "Over Voltage" error has not been
                enabled, by exceeding the specified voltage,
                the binary input operates in a dual-purpose mode which means that it records the logical signal pick up
                or trip and, also, measures the voltage and by injecting AC voltage, the binary turns into repetitive
                zeros and ones. In this case,
                the memory of the software gets full and a "Result is Full" error is displayed. Also, if the "Wet Max
                188V" is selected, the measurement precision is decreased. / / /

        <contant id="Binary_Input_Setting_Part2">
            <Search>BINARY INPUT SETTING, PART2 “Reverse” column: In "False" mode in the "Reverse" column, the logic of
                binary’s becoming 0 and 1 is the same as described earlier. If the "True" mode is selected, the
                detection logic of the binary's becoming 1
                is reversed. For example, in the "Wet Max 188V" level with a 50V threshold, if the binary voltage goes
                below 50V, its status is detected as 1, otherwise, it equals 0. In the "Dry", the "Binary Input" status
                is 1 only when it's "Open Circuit"
                and it's 0 in the short circuit state. / / The “Show Actual Value” column: In the "Show Actual Value"
                column, the mode of displaying the actual voltage value of the input binary is selected from "AC" and
                "DC". The "DC" mode is used for
                situations where the input voltage of the "Binary Input" is "DC". The "AC" mode, on the other hand, is
                for situations where the incoming voltage to the "Binary Input" is "AC". In this case, this is done for
                a better display and precision
                of the phase calibration and frequency. "None" mode is used for not displaying the actual value of the
                binaries. To view the actual value in the "Vector View", it is possible to view the measured value by
                the binary after opening this
                window. / / “Show Result” column: In the “Show Result” column, it is specified that whether the changes
                of the 1 and 0 logical signals of the “Binary Input” should be recorded by the software or not. “True”
                means that the logical signal
                should be recorded and “False” means the opposite. For example with 50 voltage threshold and “False” for
                “Show Result” and “Reverse” the trip signal is sent by the relay to the device. As signal of binary
                input 1 excess the threshold the
                binary changes are not recorded by “signal view” becqause the signals are not being recorded / / DC
                Voltage Injection: In the "Apply VDC" column, it is possible to inject a DC voltage into the binary
                input. For example, in the "Wet Max
                188V" with a 50V threshold, the number 100V is entered and subsequently the wiring to inject the DC
                voltage into the binary input is displayed. According to this wiring, the output relay contact is
                switched to "Wet". In this case, if the
                input voltage of the binary exceeds 50V, the "Binary Input" equals 1. It should be noted that it is
                possible to inject DC voltage only into one "Binary Input" and not into multiple Binary Inputs
                simultaneously. If for any reason, the output
                relay contact is corrupted, it may not get stimulated by the 2V on the "Binary Input" of the device; so
                a, for example, 100V DC is injected into it. In this case, a mild current passes through the relay
                contact and its short-circuiting
                is detected. / The “Description” column: In this column, there is some information about the condition
                where the binary input of the device equals 1. For example, in the “Wet Max 188V” with a 50V threshold,
                when the input voltage exceeds
                50V, the binary status equals 1. / Configuration of the Binary Input 9 and 10: As mentioned before,
                "Input" 9 is used for measuring currents up to 500mA and "Input" 10 is used for measuring Voltages up to
                240mV. The columns "Show Result",
                "Reverse", "Threshold", Apply VDC" and "Description" are disabled for these two binaries. In the "Binary
                Input Type" column, the precision of "Input" 9 is set. On the back of this binary, there are four 1ohm,
                20ohm, 100ohm and 1megaohm
                resistors which are used to measure the current in different ranges. By selecting any of these resistors
                in the "Binary Input Type" column, the 500mV voltage is divided into the resistor and the measurable
                current is calculated by the
                binary. It is, also, possible to display the actual measured current and voltage value in “DC” or “AC”
                in the “Show Actual Value” column. / /

            <Search>BINARY OUTPUT’S SETTING Under the “Binary Output” tab in the “Hardware Configuration” window, the
                settings related to Binary Outputs of the device are set. “AMT 105” has four Binary Outputs and on the
                back of each of them, there is a 10amp/240V
                relay. Activation or deactivation of “Binary Output” is determined in the "Binary Output Target" column.
                For example, to activate “Binary Output 1”, by clicking on the related field, it is possible to select a
                target according to your
                need from the drop-down list. For example, for Open / Close command of power keys, you can select
                “CB52a” and “CB52b”. To deactivate this output, select “Not Used” in the same drop down list. By
                checking the square option above the device’s
                “Binary Output” numbers, it is possible to activate or deactivate all 4 binaries at the same time. In
                the “Binary Output Label” column just like “Binary Input” section, a “Label” is selected for the
                activated Binary Outputs. / After setting
                the related settings, it is necessary to become familiar with the application of binary outputs. In the
                older versions of the software, the "Binary Output" was opened and closed only once in each "State" but
                in new versions of the software,
                there is a feature added that allows you to change the status of Binary Outputs up to 4 times in a
                state. The initial status of a “Binary Output” can be changed in several ways. 1- In the “Bin. Out”

                both sections at the same time.
                / 3- It is, also, possible to change the status of a “Binary Output” from “Binary Output” tab in “Detail
                View” section. To determine additional start/stop and other options in a state, “Detail View” section
                should be used. In this section,
                for every “State”, you can change the status of Binary Outputs up to 4 times. By entering your desired
                time in "1st Ch.", "2nd Ch.", "3rd Ch." and "4th Ch." you can specify the time for changing the Binary
                Output status. For example, in
                a normal situation, "Bin. Out1" is open. If number "1" is entered in "1st Ch." column, it means that
                after performing the test, "Bin. Out" is open for 1 second and then it closes. If "2" is entered in "2nd
                Ch." column, it means that 2
                seconds after closing, the "Binary Output" must open. As All these changes are simultaneously displayed
                in "Signal View" as well. You can, similarly, determine the change time for the 3rd and 4th states of
                the "Binary Output" for "3rd
                Ch." and "4th Ch." columns. / In the Trigger column, it is possible to set a condition for executing the
                changes for “Binary Output” and no changes are made to the “Binary Output” until the "Trigger" condition
                is met and the binary remains
                the same. After the “Trigger” condition is met, the “Binary Output”, immediately, starts changing its
                status according to the specified time. By clicking on the “Toggle” column, a list of other Binary
                Outputs is opened and by selecting
                any of them, the status of the “Binary Output” will be the opposite of the intended binary. This means
                that whenever “Binary Out 1” is closed, “Binary Out 3” must be open and vice versa. These changes are,
                also, displayed in “Signal View”.

            <Search>EXTRA SETTING Under the "Extra Setting" tab in the "Hardware Configuration" page, the settings for
                the serial port of the device as well as some other operation enhancer settings are set. In tests where
                the test run time is longer than 100
                seconds, a lot of memory is required to display the "Actual Value" in "Signal View" throughout the test.
                This amount of information slows down the software. By checking "Save last actual data" in "Extra
                Setting" during the test run, the
                "Actual Value" is displayed in "Signal View", for example in the last 10 seconds of the test, according
                to the amount of data. In fact, this option plays the role of a short memory oscilloscope. By clicking
                on "Maximum fan during test"
                during the test run, the fan of the device starts working in "Maximum fan" mode and after the test ends,
                it returns to normal mode. In “Binary Link Serial” field, it is possible to enter a number between 0 and
                255 so that before the test
                begins, the device sends a command to the equipment test board through “Binary Output” number four and
                this board adjusts the appropriate connections for any of the equipment tests in accordance with the
                received command. / In this section,
                there is a part named “Serial Setting”. By adjusting the settings in this section, it is possible to
                send a serial "Packet" in each "State" via the "AMT105" device. In the "Baud Rate" field, the
                transmitting and receiving speed the speeds
                must be the same are adjusted for making the connection. In "Data" field, the bit number of each data
                that is sent is specified. In this section, to identify the end of the original data, one or two bits,
                which are called "Stop bit", are
                sent. The "Parity" field is used to indicate whether the number of 1 bits is odd or even and is also
                used to identify the error code. In the "Initial Serial Command" section, you can write a message to
                identify the data exchange. After
                setting under the "Serial" tab in "Detail View", the sent command is written in the "Serial Command"
                field. For each "State" of the device, the "AMT105" can send a command for the intended equipment. In
                fact, this section can be used in
                equipment test because there is an interface board between the "AMT105" and the equipment being tested.
                By doing this while performing the test, the device sends a "Serial Command" to the board and this board
                adjusts the settings according
                to the "Serial Command". For example, send "abc" to "State1" and "cvf" to "State2". / / /

                information of the relay on this page there are
                several ways. In the first case, the user reads all the information of the relay and enters manually.
                For example, to enter the nominal Specifications of the relay, you can double-click on “Device” in the
                “Service Setting” page in the
                “Nominal Values” section and enter frequency and nominal voltage of the PTs as well as the nominal
                current of the CTs. / Also, it is possible to enter information such as device name, serial number etc.
                in the “Device” section. After that,
                to save the information, it is necessary to click on “OK”. It should be noted that whatever is in the
                "Device" block on the "Device Setting" page also exists in the "Device" block Tree diagram and the
                values ​​can be entered here too.
                For example, there is a series of information about nominal values of the device, “Substation”, “Bay”,
                “Nominal Values”, etc. You can also find this information in the branches of “Device” Tree diagram. This
                means that in the “Name plate”
                section, you can also find information about device’s ID or in the “Nominal Values” section, you can
                find information about the nominal values of the relay. If “Vebko” is entered in the “Value” field, in
                the “Device Name” row in the “Name
                Plate” section, by opening the “Device” page, this word is also recorded in the intended section. / In

                of the relays manually, it is,
                also, necessary to manually enter the specifications of the protective function. For example, to enter
                the specifications of the “Distance” protective function, you can enter the related information such as
                tolerances, length and angle
                of the line by clicking on “Distance” block in the “Distance Protective Parameters” page. You can also

                on “New” to open a new row and
                then click on “Edit” and in the opened page enter the zone information according to the relay catalog

                block, the entered information can
                be seen in the form of a tree diagram. For example, the information related to “Zone” is displayed in
                this section too. You should note that these sections are linked. To enter information of functions such
                as “Differential” and “Over

                You can also search for your intended word, by entering it in the “Tree” section. For example, by
                entering “360” degrees in “Value”,
                the parameters that have this value are displayed and if the word “Distance” is entered, this block and

        <contant id="Introducing_the_Rio">
            <Search>INTRODUCING THE “RIO” By opening a “Rio” file in notepad, you see that the specifications of the
                relay are mentioned in this file. For example, between “BEGIN DEVICE” and “END DEVICE” section,
                information and nominal specifications of the
                relay are mentioned. Or, in the “BEGIN DEVICE” section to the “END DISTANCE”, the information regarding
                the distance function and in the “BEGIN ZONE” section, the information regarding the relay zones are.
                Similarly, all the relay information
                is mentioned in this file. / By having a “Rio” file, you can “Load” this file in “Test Object” through
                “File” option. After loading, all of the information existing in the Rio file is displayed. So, the
                second method for entering information
                of relays whose software gives a “Rio” output file, is loading “Rio” file in “Test Object”. This is how
                the relay information is loaded in the software. / The point is that the information in a “Rio” file is
                fixed, meaning that it is not
                possible to add or delete a new block or parameter in the “Device” block. In fact, “Rio” is a fixed file
                and much of the "Test Object" design is related to the "Rio" file design. The purpose of "Rio" file is
                that, for example, each "Distance"
                relay be end to “Device” and “Distance” blocks and contain a series of nominal specifications, zones and
                a series of times. However, it is possible that the “Distance” relay itself contains thousands of
                parameters and not all of these
                parameters exist in the “Rio” file but ultimately the “Rio” output file of the “Distance” relay contains
                information mentioned in “Device” and “Distance” blocks. This is, also, true for “Differential” and
                “Overcurrent” relays. So, the
                “Rio” file is a fixed part of the relay settings and includes information related to “Device” block and
                protective functions. Also, the “CB Configuration” block is added to “Rio” files for simulation of power
                key operation. It is possible
                to add other blocks to “Rio” file. For example, by opening “AMT Distance” room from “Test Object” window
                it is possible to add another block, if necessary, by right-clicking on “Rio” and selecting the “Add
                Block” option. / After making
                a new block, it is possible to rename it by right-clicking on the block. Assume that a relay has two
                functions of “Distance” and “Under Excitation”. These functions are tested by the impedance method. So
                it is necessary that there are
                two “Distance” blocks in this section. After adding a new block, by right-clicking on it and selecting
                “Rename Block”, its name is changed to “Under Excitation”. By double-clicking on “Under Excitation”
                block and selecting “Zone Setting”
                tab on this page, a “Quad” zone is defined for this block according to the described settings. After
                that, click on “OK”. / Now that there are two “Distance” blocks, one of them should be active. If the
                cube next to the block is colored,
                it means that it is active; if it white, it means that it is not active. Now, if you click on “OK”, the
                information of the active distance block is displayed. Here, the “Mho” characteristic is active. Now,
                for activating the second distance
                block it is necessary to right-click on the intended block in the “Test Object” window and select “Set
                as Active Function”. By doing this, the intended block is activated and the previous block is
                deactivated and by clicking on “OK” the
                characteristics of “Distance” and “Under Excitation” blocks that are from the “Quad” type are displayed
                in the “Impedance View”. Also, in the advanced mode, it is possible to mix these two blocks. By
                right-clicking on each block of “Rio”
                file, it is possible to delete it. / Column Description: Each of these parameters has some information
                in their row. In the “State” column, by double-clicking on each cell, “Rio Parameter Viewer” page is
                opened. In the “Enabled” section,
                you can activate or deactivate this parameter. By deactivating a parameter, the status of its “state”
                changes. In the “Name” column, the name of the intended parameter is provided. In the “ID” column, there
                is a unique name selected for
                each parameter. In the “Description” column, there is an additional description provided for the
                intended parameter. / In the “Value” column, the user can select a value for the intended parameter. In
                the “Type” column, the type of the
                inserted data for the parameter is specified. In the “Min” and “Max” columns, the minimum and maximum
                allowed value for the parameter are specified. The “Formula” column is an indicator of that whether this
                parameter is derived from a
                formula or is dependent on another parameter. More will be said about this column in the “XRio” section.
                / How to make a Rio file by Excel: The point is that there is a series of relays that do not provide a
                “Rio” file as an output. To
                get a “Rio” file from this type of relays, click on the “Excel to Rio Files” icon on the “Rio Converter
                Excel” page. Then, select your intended relay from the list. In this list, you can find the name of
                relays whose “Excel” file exists
                in the created software. After selecting the relay, its related “Excel” file opens. On this page, you
                can enter information about the relay and after entering the information, by clicking on the “Save Rio
                File” option, a “Rio” file is
                created from the intended relay. This “Rio” file can be imported by using the “Import from File” icon
                and after that you can save the relay information. By selecting “Advanced” from the “View” menu, a new
                row is added to this toolbar page
                so you can add or delete new blocks or parameters manually if you decide to do that. / /

        <contant id="Introducing_XRIO">
            <Search>INTRODUCING “XRIO” The first matter that should be discussed in the “XRIO” part of the instruction
                is the reason for turning to these files. The first reason was that “RIO” files did not have a specific
                set of standards for coding. For example,
                if from the list of “RIO” files of the relays on the “Load XRio and Rio File From list” page which is
                provided in the software, the and files are opened in the notepad, you can see that these two files have
                different coding and there is
                no specific standard to them. The second reason was that when an "RIO" file was loaded, only "RIO"
                information was available. "RIO" information is that into which all relay settings can be compiled. For
                example, when “Distance” characteristic
                of the “Micom” relay is translated and the characteristic curve is formed, there is some information
                that is not inserted into the software. For example, it is possible that it exists in the relay of
                “power swing blocking” function but
                its information is not inserted into the “RIO” because, basically, it is not possible to do so. The
                third reason was that specification changes of the relay were not the same in relay and the software. It
                means that, if the user made a
                change to the translated “RIO” which was a known format, it is not clear that which settings needed to
                change in the relay so that it could follow the curve of specified characteristics. The fourth reason
                was that if a parameter was changed
                from the setting of the relay, it was necessary to get those settings, again, from the “RIO” relay and
                this file had to be loaded and translated in the software so that the relay and software settings were
                exactly the same. The second
                important matter which is related to “XRio” is that the user needs to know the components of an “XRio”
                file and what happens when it is loaded in the Vebko software. To explain this a little further, a
                “XRio” file is loaded from the “Micom
                p441” relay. You can see that the first thing that happens is that a “SCRIPT FUNCTION” and a tree
                diagram of the settings are formed in this section of the software. In the end, the “RIO” which is a
                translated version of the relay characteristics
                is completed. We will discuss more the concept of “XRIO” and its components in future videos. /

            <Search>XRIO CONVERTER FILE To further study the “XRio Converter” file, by clicking on “Import from list”
                icon on the “Load XRio Converter and Rio file from list” page, an “XRio Converter” file related to the
                “AREVA MiCOM P441” is loaded. After the
                “XRio Converter” file is loaded, it is possible to export this file from the software separately. To do
                this, by clicking on “File” menu, you can export the “XRio Converter” file in forms of with or without
                formula. In this part, for a
                better understanding, first, export the “XRio Converter” file without formula by using the “Export
                without formula….” option. / Then, the same “XRio Converter” file is loaded in the software without
                formula. By opening the “XRio Converter”
                file in notepad++, you can see that this file is written in “xml” format. In the subset of "XRio", the
                version and language of the file are defined. It is then observed that the "XRio Converter" file without
                formula consists of two main
                parts of "Rio Converter" and "Rio Type". / By opening the “Rio Converter” section, you can see that this
                section consists of another section named “Properties” where information about date and time are
                mentioned. In fact, the style of
                this type of coding is “xml” where each section opens and closes with a tag. For example, “XRio” tag is
                opened here and again closed in the end and the “/” sign indicates its closure. also, it is possible to
                open or close the “Rio Converter”
                tag by clicking on the square next to it. The “ScriptReference” tag is opened and closed in the same
                line because there is a “/” sign in the end. The second part which is the “Rio Type” tag, contains fixed
                information of the relay and
                is the same “Rio” file as described before. / By opening this tab, it is observed that the “Rio” tag
                consists of “DEVICE”, “DISTANCE”, “OVERCURRENT”, “CBCONFIGURATION” blocks which are originated from the
                relay specifications. These blocks
                are the “xml” model of the “Rio” file which is included in the “XRio Converter” file. As it is written,
                the “Rio” tag is of the “Block” kind. By opening this block it is observed that the “Rio” block consists
                of other blocks. By opening
                this block it is observed that inside this block there is a “DEVICEMODEL” which is of the “Parameter”
                kind. This means that this block has a “value” of “P441 P442 P444”. Likewise, there are other parameters
                including “MANUFACTURER”, “DEVICETYPE”,
                etc. in the “NAMEPLATE” block. / / This information can be observed in the “Vebko AMPro Test” software
                after entering the “XRio Converter” file. The information related to “XRio Converter” file is available
                in the “Test Object” window.
                In the tree diagram of this section is the “XRio Converter” block and its subsets -similar to the “Rio”
                Block-. Likewise, the “Device” block and its subsets are -similar to the “Name Plate” block-. In the
                “Name Plate” block the parameters
                mentioned in “XRio” are entered in the table. For example, the “DEVICE MODEL” parameter which has the
                value of “P441 P442 P444”, is displayed in the “Value” column of this table. As another example, in the
                “Rio” block in the “XRio Converter”
                file and in the path of “DISTANCE” and “PROTECTEDOBJECT” blocks, it is observed that the value of “LINE”
                is entered for “PT connection” with “ID”:”PTCONN”. / If you follow the same path in the “Test Object”
                window in the “Vebko AMPro Test”
                software, namely the “Distance” directory in the “Rio” block, you can see in the “Protected Object”
                table that for a parameter with “ID” :”PTCONN” in the “Value” column, “at line” is entered while in the
                “XRio Converter” file, “Line” was
                entered as the value. The reason for the difference in values of the“Vebko AMPro Test” software and the
                “XRio Converter” file is that the codes written in the “Rio” section, receive the values from “XRio” and
                then enter the corresponding
                values for different parameters in accordance with design of the codes, which is here “Line” for a
                parameter with “ID”:”PTCONN” in the “XRio” corresponds to “at line” in “Rio”. / In “Vebko AMPro Test”
                software, there are columns like “Name”,
                “Description”, etc. for each parameter which provides the user with information about the intended
                parameter and there may be no code for these sections in the “XRio Converter” file. Initialization of
                these columns in the "Rio" is in the
                way that according to the code written by the programer, wherever in the "ID" column the phrase "PTCONN"
                is written, its name is "PT Connection" and "Potential transformer connection side" is entered as
                described in the "Description" column
                for it. Also, the programer coded other columns like “Type” has mentioned it in the code to be displayed
                in the “Rio” section. For the mentioned parameter it is “Enumeration” which means that it is selective
                and the user can select a value
                from the drop-down field in the “Value” column. / It should be noted that for every piece of information
                in the “Custom” part which is not fixed, its code must be written in “XRio”. This will be more explained
                in future videos. Another
                point is that the “User Interface” mode is included in “Rio” section. This means that by double-clicking
                on any block of the subsets of “Rio”, for example, “Device” block, the “Device Setting” page opens where
                all parameters of the subset
                of this block can be observed and changed. These changes are, simultaneously, recorded in parameters
                table as well. But, if you double-click on any block other than “Rio”, a series of information about
                “ID” of the block as well as its
                name are displayed.

        <contant id="XRio_Converter_Part2">
            <Search>XRIO CONVERTER, PART2 After identifying the problems with “RIO” files, “OMICRON” company decided to
                implement a new idea. According to this idea, a file format named “XRIO” was created in which a section
                named “Relay parameter section” was
                designed for every relay and all relay menus were arranged and addressed exactly the same way as in the
                relay software. / Another section of this file is “Additional information” which includes that necessary
                information which is not available
                in the relay software and should be read from its catalogue. For example, if you click on “General
                information” tree diagram on “General” block, you can see that “AREVA” is recorded as the “Manufacturer”
                which is not available in the relay
                menu but is necessary to complete the device information. / / The important point in getting familiar
                with “XRio” is that you should know how “XRio” blocks are defined. For example, in “Relay Parameter
                Section” tree diagram and in the
                “SYSTEM DATA” block, the “Language” parameter is of “Enumeration” type and its value is defined as
                “English”. Now, if the “XRio” file of this relay is opened in “Notepad++”, after opening the “Custom”
                tag, you can see the “Setting” block,
                “ID_00” block and parameter with “id=ID_0001”. The “Name”, “ForeignId” and “DataType” of this parameter
                are “Language”, “0001” and “Enumeration” respectively. In the “EnumList” tag, you can see that, four
                languages including English, French,
                German and Spanish are available as “Value” for this section and in this case “English” has been
                selected. / / Now, if you return to the “Vebko AMPro Test” software, you can see the exact same
                information in the “Test Object” section.
                This means that by double-clicking on “Relay Parameter Section” in the tree diagram you can see that its
                “ID” is defined as “SETTINGS”; then by double-clicking on the “System Data” block you can see that its
                “ForeginID” is defined as “ID_00”.
                In its parameters table, you can see that “Enumeration” is defined as “Type” for the parameters named
                “Language” and “ForeignID:0001”. Also, in the “Value” field there are four languages of English, French,
                German and Spanish available
                where “English” is selected by default in accordance with the displayed codes. / After an “XRio” file is
                loaded, the necessary settings and information of the “Rio” section are completed accordingly and the
                cells whose information is dependent
                on a formula or parameter from the “XRio” file, are turned purple. For example, the value of nominal
                frequency in the “Nominal Values” block is defined according to a formula from the “Formula” column and
                if this value is modified manually,
                the color of the cell changes to pink which means that there is no more a connection between the value
                of this cell and the formula defined for it. To make the value of this cell again dependent on the
                formula, right-click on it and select
                "Recalculate formula". / To find out about that how the nominal frequency with purple color is defined,
                first, you should select it and then click on the “Reference Map” icon to view a map of the parameters
                to which the frequency is dependent.
                By clicking on any of the boxes in this section, the parameter that affects the final value of the
                frequency is displayed which, in here, the frequency is taken from “Fnom”. The value of “Fnom” parameter
                is, itself, based on a formula
                and is dependent on another parameter which by clicking on the “Map” box, you can see that a parameter
                named “Frequency” is used. This means that, since “50” is set as the value for “Nominal Values”, the
                value for “Fnom” is, according
                to its formula, “50” too and finally the amount of nominal frequency in “Nominal Values”, according to
                the defined relation, is “50” Hz. / Now, if you open the “XRio” file in “Notepad++”, you can view the
                path that was used to find the
                affective parameters in the software in the codes of this file. Follow the path “Rio-Device-Nominal
                Value” in the codes of this file until you find “Fnom”. You can see that this parameter has a value of
                “50” but has a “ValueRefList” whose
                affective parameters are in the mentioned “Reference”. To find this parameter, you need to follow the
                mentioned path which is “CUSTOM.RIOPLUS.POWERSYSTEMPARAMETERS.FNOM”. You can see that type, value, unit
                and formula of this parameter
                are mentioned in this path. It is mentioned in the formula of this section that if “ID_0009=FIFTY”, the
                value for this parameter is 50, otherwise it equals 60. It is also necessary to define the two phrases
                “ID_0009” and “FIFTY”. To view
                the definition of these two phrases, you need to open the “ValueRefList” tag. You can see that there is
                a “Value reference list” mentioned for each of these phrases. For “ID_0009” you should follow the path
                “CUSTOM.SETTINGS.ID_00” and
                find the value of “ID_0009”. In this case, you can see that this parameter is named “Frequency” and its
                “ForeginID:0009” and is of the “Enumeration” type. Also, in the “EnumList” tag, “50” Hz is defined for
                “FIFTY” while “60” Hz is defined
                for “SIXTY”. / The explained case is a very simple example of defining parameters values of a relay for
                test. An another example, it is possible to select and open the “ZONE P GROUND” block from the tree
                diagram of the distance block and
                then click on “M3” to view its parameters in the table. If the “Reference Map” of the “Angle” parameter
                is opened, you can see that this parameter is dependent on many other parameters. By clicking on any of
                the available boxes in this
                “Reference Map”, the given parameter for address is displayed.

        <contant id="Complementary_explanation_about_XRio_Converter">
            <Search>COMPLEMENTARY EXPLANATION ABOUT “XRIO CONVERTER” In previous sections, some explanations about “XRio
                converter” and ways of addressing parameters were provided. According to what have been said, “XRio” has
                a series of “Xml” codes as well as
                various parts such as “Script”, “Custom” and “Rio”. In “Custom”, all the information that is included in
                a tree diagram of the software is defined in “XRio Converter”. “Script” includes intermediate functions
                by using which it is easier
                to create or define blocks and parameters of “Custom”. “Rio” block, mostly, contains specific fixed
                parts some of which such as “Name” and “Description” do not exist in the codes of “XRio Converter” and
                are added to the “Vebko AmPro Test”
                software separately. As has already been said, if the cell color of any parameter is purple, it means
                that the value of this parameter is obtained by using from a formula and is related to some other
                parameters. To investigate the relationship
                between parameters and the influence of each parameter on other parameters, open its “Reference map”.
                For a more thorough examination of “Reference map”, if you select “Frequency” parameter from “System
                Data” block and then open its “Reference
                map”, by selecting “Reference End To this Node” radio button, you can see that this parameter affects
                two other parameters. You can see those parameters by clicking on any of the boxes in which your
                intended parameter’s address is mentioned.
                / As another example, if you click on “DISTANCE ELEMENT” from “SETTING GROUP” tree diagram and open
                “Reference map” after selecting “Zp” parameter, you can see that this parameter has influence on so many
                other parameters in the settings
                of this relay and by changing this parameter, the related ones change too. On this page, in addition to
                observing the relationship between parameters based on value, it is possible to specify that based on
                what parameter is each block
                or parameter active or inactive. For example, by selecting “AUTORECLOSE” block and opening its
                “Reference map”, you can see that this block’s activeness is related to “Internal A/R” parameter but
                because “Disabled” mode is selected in
                the “Value” column, this block is inactive as well. / As another example, if you select “Dead time2”
                parameter from “AUTORECLOSE” and select “Enable” radio button from “Reference map”, you can see that
                this parameter’s activeness is related
                to the four other parameters displayed on the map of this page ”Reference map”. /

        <contant id="XRio_and_XRio_Converter">
            <Search>XRIO AND XRIO CONVERTER After getting familiar with “XRio Converter”, it is necessary to, also, get
                familiar with the concept of “Name”, “ID”, “Foregin ID” and “Description”. ”ID” Definition: The relay
                producer companies define a unique “ID”
                for every parameter and in all relays of a brand, this ‘ID” is used for a specific parameter; for
                example, in the “7UT613” Siemens relay, “ID=21015” is related to the “PROT.OBJECT” parameter. This “ID”
                is used in other relays produced
                by this company for the same parameter. Also, in connecting to the relay via Modbus protocol, if this
                “ID” is sent to the relay as a “Packet”, the relay will return the parameter value related to the sent
                “ID”. / ”Foreign ID”: Unlike “ID”
                which is used as a standard for identification of the same parameters in relays produced by a company,
                “Foreign ID” is used as a means of differentiation between parameters of different relays which allows
                them to be used in other software’s.
                As an example, in “7UT613” relay of Siemens, there is a parameter named “PROT.OBJECT” defined with
                “ID=21015” and “Foreign ID=0105”. If the user intends to enter and analyze some models of relays
                produced by different companies in a software
                like “Digsilent”. / The interesting point is that in some relays such as Siemens, the “ID” and “Foreign
                ID” are different while in some other relays such as “P441”, after loading its file in the “Load XRio
                and Rio file from list” page,
                it can be seen that the “ID” and “Foreign ID” are the same. Also, in “Name” and “Description” sections
                there is information, provided by the producer company, about name of the parameter as well as some
                description about that parameter.
                / An introduction to “XRio” and its difference with “XRio Converter”: By clicking on the “Import from
                list” icon on the “Load XRio and Rio file from list” page, “XRio Converter” of a relay is selected where
                the information regarding the
                relay is complete in the “Custom” and “Rio” sections. It should be noted that it is not possible to
                extract the “XRio Converter” file from a relay because producer companies do not put the file in their
                relays. In fact, the relay producer
                companies never limit their relays to a single tester device such as “Omicron”. / / Therefore, instead
                of the “XRio Converter” file, the relay producer companies provide a file with “.CSV” or “.text” format
                in which information of the
                “Custom” section along with the values set to the relay can be found. Upon extensive use of “XRio” which
                has been created by “Omicron” company, most relay producers decided to provide their users with “XRio”
                output files of their relays
                too. You should consider that this file is not the same as the “XRio Converter” file which is designed
                and written by producers of the tester device and is available in the tester software. The “XRio” file
                of the relay contains “Custom”
                section as well as “Relay Parameter Section” and “Additional Information” blocks with the information
                and values set to the relay, but it does not contain “Rio Plus” and “Template Controller” sections. If,
                in the tester software, the “XRio
                Converter” file is selected correctly, after loading the “XRio” file of the relay in the “XRio
                Converter”, the settings and necessary information of the relay are completely imported to the “Rio”
                section. / Some more points regarding “XRio”
                and “XRio Converter” should be mentioned: The first point is that if the “XRio” file of the “7SA522”
                relay is opened in “notepad++”, by opening the “Rio Converter” tag it can be seen that unlike “XRio
                Converter”, there are no “Script References”
                functions in this section. Einige weitere Punkte zu „XRio“ und „XRio Converter“ sollen noch erwähnt
                warden: / The second point is that in the “Custom” tag, only information regarding “Setting” block is
                available which is the same as “Relay
                Parameter Section” in the software and in some relays such as “7SA522”, the information regarding
                “Additional Parameter” is also available which is the same as “Additional Information” in the software.
                Also, the information regarding “Device”
                block has been made available in the “Rio” section by a producer of the relay. / / / The third point is
                that if the “XRio” file of a relay is selected and loaded by clicking on “Import from file” and without
                “XRio Converter”, it can be
                seen that the mentioned sections are available in the “XRio” section of the software but because of not
                using the “XRio Converter”, the values of “RIO” section are not linked with the “XRio” information and
                only the “DEVICE” section has
                been completed according to the information of the “XRIO” file. / The last point is that if the “XRio”
                file of a differential relay such as “7UT613” is loaded in a universal room such as the sequencer room,
                in the “Rio” section, the blocks
                other than those completed according to the settings of the relay and information of the loaded “XRio”
                by “XRio Converter”, like “Distance” block which are entered to the software by the designer of the
                tester are empty of information
                because in the “XRio” file of the relay there is no information about them.

            <Search>XRIO & RELAY SETTING IN THE SOFTWARE After getting familiar with “XRio” file that is provided by the
                relay as an output, it is necessary to get familiar with other sections of this file. First, open the
                “XRio” file of the “7SA522” Siemens
                relay with “notepad++”. In this file, the relay provides the user with the information regarding the
                “Setting” as well as the values that are “Set” to the relay. As it has been said before, in this file,
                unlike “XRio Converter”, there
                are no “Script References” functions in “Rio Converter” tag. / The information related to “Relay
                Parameter Section” block with “ID=Setting” can be found in the “Custom” tag while the relay parameter
                information is available in its subcategories.
                For example, you can find “ID=PID_16611”, “Description=Setting Group Change Option”, “Foreign ID= 0103”,
                “Data Type= Enumeration” and “Enum List” in the parameter with “Name= Grp Chge OPTION”. Moreover, the
                information regarding “Device”
                block is mentioned in the “Rio” section. / Entering relay information in the software: Before loading
                the “7SA522” relay settings in “Vebko AMvPro Test” software, it is necessary, the “XRio Converter” file
                related to “7SA522” Siemens relay,
                which is available in the “Vebko AMPro Test” software, to be loaded. By clicking on “Import from list”
                icon, the “Load XRio and Rio file from list” page opens. On this page, in “XRio” mode, the model of
                “7SA522” relay is entered in the
                “Search” field. Then, its “XRio Converter” should be selected. After this file is loaded, the “XRio”
                file of the relay should be entered. To do this, click on “File” menu, then select “Load Relay Setting”.
                After that, select “XRio” relay
                output format from “Relay Config Type” field. / / In the “Config file path” the path to the “XRio” file
                is determined and the “XRio” file is selected. In the “Matching Algorithm” section, the user needs to
                specify the type of information
                that is to be loaded from the “XRio” file to the “XRio Converter”. If “Equal ID” option is checked and
                the other options are unchecked, then, only those parameters of the relay whose “ID” is the same in the
                “XRio” and “XRio Converter”
                files are loaded in the software. By clicking on “OK”, a message is displayed. In this message, the
                phrase “Parameter Values Imported” shows the number of parameters that are loaded in the software and
                their “ID” is the same as the “XRio
                Converter”. / Also, the “Different Names” phrase shows the number of loaded parameters that have the
                same “ID” but whose “Name” is not the same in “XRio” and “XRio Converter” files. The phrase “Corrected
                Names” shows the number of parameters
                whose “Name”, being different, is corrected by the software in accordance with the “XRio Converter”. The
                phrase “Errors” shows the number of erred parameters. The error can have various reasons; for example,
                the “Type” of a “Text” parameter
                can be specified as “String” in the “XRio Converter”. The phrase “Corrected Errors” shows the number of
                parameters whose error is corrected according to the “XRio Converter”. The phrase “Duplicate IDs” shows
                the number of parameters that
                have the same “ID” or “Foreign ID” in “XRio Converter” or “XRio” file. In such a case, Vebko software
                does not load the values of these parameters. / After clicking on “OK”, the relay information is loaded
                in the “XRio Converter”. After
                the relay information is loaded, the parameters entered on the left side are displayed in “Relay Config
                Log” field at the bottom of “Test Object” page while “xml” format of the “XRio” file is displayed on the
                right side. For example, the
                “Grp Chge OPTION” parameter is loaded in the software with no problem or the name of “RG/RLZ1” parameter
                in “XRio” file is different from its name in “Xrio Converter” file. / / Load Relay Setting Page: By
                reopening “Load Relay Setting”
                window, after determining the format of the relay file and selecting the path of “XRio” file, by
                clicking on “Advanced View” option, a window with the same name opens. Tree diagrams and the “xml”
                format of these two files are located at
                the top and bottom of this page, respectively, in a way that the “XRio” file of the relay can be seen on
                the right while the “XRio Converter” file can be seen on the left. If “Show XML documents” option is
                checked, these two files are,
                also, displayed as “xml”. For example, in the “XRio” file of the relay in “CUSTOM” block, the “Grp Chge
                OPTION” has “ID=PID_16611”. This parameter has the same “ID” in “CUSTOM” block in the “Xrio Converter”
                file of the software. As another
                example, a parameter in “XRio” file with “Id=PDI_25555” is named “50N – B1 instBl” while in “Xrio
                Converter” file the same “ID” is named “50N-B1 Pil/Bl”. This is why this parameter is placed in
                “Different Names” category. / / In “Matching
                Algorithm” part of the “Load Relay Setting” window, if the “Equal Foreign ID” option is checked, the
                parameters whose “Foreign ID” is the same in both “XRio” and “XRio Converter” files of the relay, are
                loaded. If the “XRio Contains Setting
                Foreign ID” and “Setting Contains XRio Foreign ID” options are checked, the parameters whose “Foreign
                ID” in “XRio” file includes some additional parameters, such as a letter or a half-space, are loaded and
                vice versa. For example, a parameter’s
                “Foreign ID= 109A” in XRio file while the same parameter’s “Foreign ID= 109A-B” in “XRio Converter”
                file. If the “XRio Contains Setting Foreign ID” option is checked, this parameter is loaded in the
                software and vice versa. / The “Equal
                Code of Foreign ID PCM600” option is for “ABB” relays. There is no connection between the “Foreign ID”
                of relay’s “XRio” and “XRio Converter” file in “XRio” file of these relays but in some conditions, the
                “Foreign”s in the “XRio” file
                of the relay and “XRio Converter” file are connected. For example, on the “Test Object” page, by
                clicking on “Import from file”, first, an “XRio Converter” related to the “ABB REL 65f0” is loaded;
                then, by clicking on “File” menu and selecting
                “Load Relay Setting” option, the “XRio” file related to this relay is selected. Also, in the “Matching
                Algorithm” tab, only the “Equal Code of Foreign ID PCM600” option is checked. By opening the “Advanced
                View” page, both files are displayed
                as “xml”. / As an example, a parameter named “BIM_3” with a specific “Foreign ID” is selected in the
                “XRio Converter” file while this parameter has a different “Foreign ID” in the “XRio” file of the relay.
                But it is seen that a part of
                the “Foreign ID” is the same in both files which means that the eight first characters and then the four
                second, third and fourth characters and the twelve fifth characters should be the same in the “Foreign
                ID” of both files so that this
                parameter is loaded in the “XRio Converter”. Then, by clicking on “OK”, it is seen that “2179”
                parameters are loaded in the “XRio Converter”. / /

                enabled. This formula is written
                as “NOT OC_101=TXT_1_101”. After clicking on “Test”, if a message saying “Test was successful” is
                displayed, the formula is correct and there is no problem. If a tiny change is made to the formula, for
                example the “ID” is changed, by clicking
                on “Test” a message saying that there is no parameter with “ID=TXT_2_101” will be displayed. Then, by
                clicking on “OK” two more messages will be displayed saying that the displayed formula is not correct
                and the last message says “Test
                was not successful”. By correcting the formula and closing the “XRio Formula Editor” window, you can see
                that the status of the block is “False” and this block, displayed with an “X” sign, is disabled. If the
                measure of “50/51” parameter
                is changed in the “Device Config” block, Value=Definite Time, the “50/51” block is enabled and the “X”
                mark is removed. / / / Likewise, it is possible to associate enabling or disabling of other blocks with
                one or several parameters. Like
                the previous situation, a formula should be written for “50” block. By repeating the previous stages and
                selecting “50/51” parameter and “Enumeration=Disabled” with “ID=TXT_1_101”, a formula should be written
                for the activeness of this
                parameter on the “XRio Formula Editor”. This formula is written as “NOT OC_101=TXT_1_101”. So, whenever
                “50/51” block is enable, this block should be enable as well. Click on “Test” to validate the written
                formula and in the end click
                on “OK”. / For enabling of “51” block, double-click on it and select “Formula”. After opening the “Add
                Ref.Param” window, select “50/51 parameter and “Enumerations” of “Disabled” and “Definite Time”. In
                fact, “51” block is enabled when
                enumerations of “Disabled” and “Definite Time” are not selected. Then, the formula is written as “NOT
                OC_101=TXT_1_101_ AND NOT OC_101=TXT_2_101”. Click on “Test” to validate the formula and finally click
                on “OK”. If “Definite Time” is
                selected as the value of “50/51” parameter in the “Device Config” block, “50/51” and “50” blocks are
                enabled while “51” block is disabled. If “Time Overcurrent” is selected as the value of “50/51”
                parameter, all three blocks are enabled.
                / / Enabling and disabling parameters: In each block, it is possible to associate Enabling of parameters
                with another parameter. For example, in “51” block, “IEC Curve” parameter is enable when “Time
                Overcurrent” is selected as the value
                of “50/51” parameter. To do this, double-click on “State” column and select “Formula” from the “Enabled”
                section. By clicking on “…”icon in the “XRio Formula Editor” window like the previous example, in the
                “Add Ref.Param” window “50/51”
                parameter and “Enumeration=Time Overcurrent” with “ID=TXT_3_101” are selected and added to the
                “References” section. The formula is written as “OC_101=TXT_3_101” at the right side and by clicking on
                “Test” the validity of the formula is
                examined and the “OK” is selected. If in “Device Config” block, “Time Overcurrent” is selected as the
                value of “50/51” parameter, “IEC Curve” parameter is enabled while if “Definite Time” is selected, “IEC
                Curve” parameter is disabled.

            <Search>WRITING FORMULA FOR “XRIO CONVERTER”4 After completing the information regarding “Relay Parameter
                Section” and “Additional Information” sections, it is necessary to-you should- complete information of
                the “Rio” section as well. In “Rio” section,
                by double-clicking on any block, a window, which includes information about parameters of that block,
                opens; this information is also available in the tree diagram of that block. For example, parameters
                like “Device Name”, “Manufacturer”,
                etc. are located in “Name Plate” block. It is possible to assign a value to these parameters directly or
                associate them with parameters from “Custom” section by using formulas. In this video, necessary
                parameters for an overcurrent function
                are linked to values from the “Custom” section. Note that in writing a formula, the “ID” of each
                parameter is used. / Linking parameters of “Rio” section: In this video –the target- our goal is to
                complete the information regarding the
                “51” function. “In”, “I prim”, etc. parameters are located at the “Nominal Values” section. To link
                values of the “In” parameter with the values of “XRio”, it is necessary to define a formula for this
                parameter. To do so, after double-clicking
                on “State” column, in “Rio Parameter Viewer” window from “Value Properties” section, click on “…” icon
                in the “Formula” field to open “XRio Formula Editor” window. On this window, first the intended
                parameter CT Secondary should be entered.
                To do this, click on “+” and in “Add Ref.Param” window, select “CT Secondary” parameter from the “XRio”
                tree diagram. Then, select “Enumeration=1A” and “ID=TXT_1_201” from the box at the bottom of the page to
                add them to the “References”
                section. -For The “In” parameter when the “CT Secondary” parameter’s “Enumeration=1A” ,the value of the
                parameter “In=1A”; otherwise, it should be “5A”. To write this formula, the “If” command is used in a
                way that the final formula is
                “IIfCT_SEC=TXT_1_201,1,5”. Then, click on “Test” to validate the formula. In the “Result” section,
                “Result Value=1A”. Finally, click on “OK” to save the settings. / / / You can see that the color of
                “Value” cell of “In” parameter is turned
                into purple which means that its value is associated with another parameter based on the formula in the
                “Formula” column. Also, by clicking on “Reference map”, you can see that the value of this parameter is
                linked to another parameter.
                By double-clicking on the box of the parameter, the given address for this parameter CT Secondary is
                displayed. If the value of this parameter is changed to “5A”, the value of “In” parameter changes
                accordingly. The value of “I prim” parameter
                is linked to the value of “CT Primary” parameter in the same way. By following the mentioned steps, “CT
                Primary” parameter is added to the “References” section. Because this parameter is of the “Real” type
                and lacks “Enumeration”, to write
                the formula, only the phrase “CT_PRIMARY” is entered. The written formula means that the “I prim”
                parameter will have the same value as the “CT Primary” parameter. / / / / “Overcurrent” block: After
                completing “Device” block, information
                of the “Overcurrent” block should be completed. By double-clicking on this block, you can see that there
                is a series of parameters in “Relay Parameters” and “Elements” tabs which are also available from the
                “Overcurrent” tree diagram separately.
                Also, in the “General” block, parameters such as “Time Tolerance Relative”, “Time Tolerance Absolute”,
                Current Tolerance Relative” and “Current Tolerance Minimum” are available. The information regarding
                these parameters is available from
                “Relay Information” block in “Custom” section. These parameters should be used in the “Rio” section as
                well. It should be noted that the value of “Reference Current” parameter is, by default, linked to the
                value of “INOM” parameter in
                the “Nominal Values” block. Double-click on the “State” column in “Time Tolerance Relative” parameter
                and on “Rio Parameter Viewer” window, click on “…” option. On the “XRio Formula Editor” window in the
                “References” section, after clicking
                on “+”, “t-Tolerance rel” parameter is added to the “References” section from the “XRio” tree diagram.
                Then, the formula is written in form of “TTOLREL”. Next, click on “TEST” and after “Test was successful”
                message is displayed, click
                on “OK”. A “5%” value is displayed in the “Result Value” section. Likewise, the value of “Time Tolerance
                Absolute” and “Current Tolerance Relative” parameters are linked to and associated with the values of
                “t-Tolerance abs” and “I-Tolerance
                rel” parameters. In the manual of the relay, “Current Tolerance Minimum” parameter is stated as that
                there is at least “10mA" and “50mA" current error in “1A” and “5A” nominal currents respectively. To
                state this parameter in the software,
                the formula should be written as “0.01*Inom”. First, it should be determined whether the nominal current
                is “1A” or “5A”. Because the “Current Tolerance Minimum” parameter is stated in accordance with “IREF”,
                to write the formula, “CT
                Secondary” and “Reference Current” parameters and “Enumeration=1A” with “ID=TXT_1_201” are should be
                selected and added to “References” section. Finally, the formula is written as
                “0.01*ifCT_SEC=TXT_1_201,1,5/IREF”. / / / / Note that in
                the “CT” block, the values of “IPrim” and “ISec” parameters are, by default, linked to the values of
                “IPRIM” and “INOM” parameters in “Nominal Values” section. Moreover, the parameters of “VT”, “Neutral
                CT” and “Residual VT” blocks are,
                by default, linked to the values of “XRio Converter”. The “Timed Overcurrent Element” subcategory in the
                “Overcurrent Elements” block gives us information about “50/51” function like “Pickup” current and
                operation time. As mentioned before,
                in this video, our goal is to complete the information of “51” function. To activate “51” block,
                double-click on “OverCurrent” block. Then, in the “Element” tab double click on “Tripping
                Characteristic” column and select “IEC Normal Inverse”
                curve from the “Manage / Select characteristic” window and then click on “OK”. Then, in the “Operating
                Curves” block, you can see that the “51” curve is defined as an “IEC Normal Inverse” and the information
                about this curve is displayed
                as well. / / /

            <Search>WRITING FORMULA FOR “XRIO CONVERTER”5 In the previous video, the information regarding “Device”
                block and some parts of “Overcurrent” block such as “General”, “CT” and “VT” were completely covered. As
                mentioned before, under the “Elements”
                tab by double-clicking on “Overcurrent” block, “Normal Inverse” curve is selected for “51” function; the
                information related to this curve is located in “Overcurrent Elements” block. Now we are going to
                complete the “Overcurrent Elements”
                block information. / Enabling a characteristic curve: As you can see, activeness or inactiveness of the
                characteristic curves is determined in “Active” column. To link the value of this parameter which is
                located in the “Timed Overcurrent
                Element” block, by following the mentioned steps in previous videos, in “Add Ref.Param” window in
                “Device Config” block, “50/51” parameter with “Enumeration=Time Overcurrent IEC” and “ID=TXT_3_101” is
                selected and in “51” block, “IEC Curve”
                parameter with “Enumeration=Normal Inverse” with “ID=TXT_1_51” is selected and added to “References”
                section. Then, the formula is written as “OC_101=TXT_3_101 AND CURVE_51=TXT_1_51”. To validate the
                written formula, click on “Test” and
                finally click on “OK”. / / Determining the value of lpickuup.nom: The parameters related to “Ipickup”
                current and its tolerances are located in “Pick up Current” block. To link the current value of
                “Ipickup” whose value is a coefficient
                of “IREF”, double click on “State” column and by clicking on icon “…” in “Value Properties” section,
                click on “+” on “XRio Formula Editor” window and select parameter “Pickup 51” from “51” block and
                “Reference Current” parameter from “General”
                block on the “XRio” tree diagram to add them to “References” section. Then, using the “ID” of added
                parameters, the formula is written in the box at the right side as “PICKUP_51/IREF”. The formula is
                validated by clicking on “Test”. The
                value of “Ipickup.nom” parameter is calculated in accordance with that the value of “Pickup 51=1A” in
                “51” block and the value of “CT Secondary=1A” in “CT’S” block. / / / Determining the current tolerances:
                To link the value of “Tolerance
                Absolute Positive” parameter with “Current Tolerance Minimum” parameter, by following the mentioned
                steps from the “XRio” tree diagram, in the “General” and “Overcurrent” blocks from the “Rio” section,
                the “Current Tolerance Minimum” parameter
                is added to “References” section and the formula is written as “CURRENTTOLABS” in the box at the right
                side and then the formula is validated. / Likewise, the values of “Tolerance Absolute Negative",
                “Tolerance Relative Positive” and “Tolerance
                Relative Negative” parameters are linked with parameters with “ID=CURRENTTOLABS”, “ID=CURRENTTOLREL” and
                “ID=CURRENTTOLREL” respectively. The “Tolerance Actual Positive” parameter selects the highest amount of
                positive tolerance from “Tolerance
                Absolute Positive” and “Tolerance Relative Positive” and based on a percentage of “IREF” puts it in its
                “Value” field. So, by following the previous steps and adding “Ref.Params”, the formula is written as
                “MaxTOLABSPOS,TOLRELPOS*NOMVAL/100”
                and validated. / / “Tolerance Actual Negative” parameter is almost the same as the previous parameter.
                The only difference is that it calculates the highest amount of negative tolerance and its formula is
                written as “MaxTOLABSNEG,TOLRELNEG*NOMVAL/100”.
                Also, for “Test Positive” parameter, the formula is written as “NOMVAL+TOLACTPOS+NOMVAL*TESTTOL/100”.
                This parameter shows the maximum total error of the test which may occur because of measurement error of
                current transformers, test device,
                noise, etc. in “Test Negative” parameter, the formula is written as “NOMVAL – TOLACTNEG –NOMVAL *
                TESTTOL / 100” which shows the minimum total error of the test. / Determining trip time and the range of
                relay performance: After determining
                current tolerances, the information related to “Time Multiplier/Trip Time” block should be completed. In
                this block, by following the mentioned steps, the value of “Nom.Time Multiplier” parameter should be
                linked with “Time Dial 51” parameter
                which is located in “51” block. / According to “IEC” standard, the “Ipickup” current value of relays can
                range from “1.1” times to “1.3” times of the nominal current. Based on the manual of this relay, “1.1”
                is selected for this relay
                which means that the relay must not “Pickup” less than the determined current. This parameter is located
                in “Min Operate Current” block with the name of “Nom.Min.Op.Curr” and its value should be linked with
                “1.1” times of the nominal current.
                So, the formula is written as “1.1*NOMVAL”. According to “IEC” standard, if the injected current is
                bigger than “20” times of the nominal current, the relay should give a trip at a “Definite” time. This
                parameter is located in “Max Operate
                Current” block with the name of “Nom.Max.Op.Curr” but in this video, we skipped entering the information
                of this parameter. It should be noted that the activeness of “Range Limits” value should be linked with
                another parameter in “Device
                Config” block. This parameter is located in “Timed Overcurrent Element” block with the name of “Use
                Range Limits”. By repeating the mentioned steps for linking and selecting the “50/51” parameter and
                “Enumeration=Time Overcurrent IEC”
                with “ID=TXT_3_101”, the formula is written as “OC_101=TXT_3_101” and after testing, the “OK” option is
                selected. You can find this parameter in “Elements” tab of “Overcurrent” block. If this option is
                enabled, the relay must not “Pickup”
                in current values less than “lmin”. / / / Final review: The information regarding the curve is mentioned
                in the tree diagram of “Operating Curves” and “Standard Curve” blocks. / You can view the changes made
                by double-clicking on “Overcurrent”
                block. Under the “Relay Parameters” tab, the tolerance values are derived from the determined formula
                and its cell color is turned purple. Also, under the “Elements” tab, the parameters for which a formula
                is determined are turned purple.
                Then, click on “Ok” so save the settings. You can see that the “Normal Inverse” curve is displayed on
                “Overcurrent Characteristic” window. / / / To further examine the validity of written “XRio” file, some
                cases are tested as a sample.
                To do this, “Disabled” is selected in “Device Config” block and then by double-clicking on “Overcurrent”
                block, you can see that the curve has been disabled. Also, by clicking on “Ok”, no curve is displayed on
                “Overcurrent Characteristic”
                window. / / As another example, the value of “Time Overcurrent IEC” is selected in “Device Config” block
                and in “51” block, “Pickup 51=4A" is determined as the current value while “Time Dial 51=0.5” is
                determined as time. In the “Overcurrent”
                block it is observed that the same changes are made. For example, the minimum current value is
                “Ipickup=4.4A”. After clicking on “OK”, the changes are made to “Overcurrent Characteristic” window. / /

                to provide some additional information
                about this section. At the left of this page, the general information about the relay is entered. This

                secondary voltage is known as
                nominal voltage while the CT secondary voltage is known as nominal current. Note that in “Vprimary” and
                “Vsecondary” section, it is possible to enter the ratio of transformation in line to line or phase. In
                “Residual Voltage/Current Factor”
                section, the coefficients of residual voltage and current for relays where the residual voltage and
                current are separated from the input voltage and current are mentioned. These coefficients are used to
                calculate VE and IE. In “Limits”
                section, the range of maximum output voltage and current of the device are specified and the user can,
                according to the type of wiring specified in “Hardware Configuration” section, determine the maximum
                output voltage and current of the
                device. / In the “Debounce Time” field In “Debounce/Deglitch Filter” section, it is specified that every
                3 milliseconds, the device examines the signal transmission from the relay. In “Deglitch Time” section,
                it is specified that the transferred
                signal from the relay should be retained for 400 microseconds until the reception of signal is detected.
                Note that both of these values can range from 200 to 1.5 microseconds. / By using “Save to template”
                option, the information entered
                in this section is saved in the software as a template and it is possible to load this template by using
                the “Load Template” option. The “Import” option is used when the user wishes to use the settings of this
                section on another computer
                or to be able to recover the settings after cleaning the cache of the software. /

            <Search>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE SEQUENCER ROOM After getting familiar with “Hardware Configuration” and “Test
                Object” pages which are used for configuring the device and entering the relay characteristics, now it
                is time to get familiar with the "AMT-Sequencer"
                room. As mentioned in previous videos, “AMT-Seque ncer”, is the main room of the software and it is
                possible to design, run and evaluate all tests of the relays and equipment from this room. To design any
                test, first, it is necessary to
                become familiar with the pages as well as features of this room. This room includes all windows,
                diagrams and options that a user needs for doing a test. / “Table View” window: different states of
                injected signal, analog and digital inputs
                and outputs of the device for performing a test are created in this window as tables named “state”. /
                “Detail View” window: details related to each “State”, including the type of “State”, status of “Binary
                Outputs”, status of all “States”
                etc. are located in this window. / “Signal View” window: the overall waveform of the output signal of
                the device and “Binaries/Analog”s of inputs and outputs of the device during a test are displayed in

        <contant id="Table_View_window">
            <Search>“TABLE VIEW” WINDOW The first step in designing a test is to make different states of the test in
                “Table View” window. This means that to simulate fault state, it is necessary to inject signal several
                stage and receive feedback. Every stage
                of the test is showed on this window in form of a table named “state” and each “state” is made of
                several components. / To open the “Table View” window, it is possible to use “View” menu or the toolbar
                at the top of the page. In the first
                part of every “state”, RMS value, phase and frequency of the outputs of the device, which are selected
                in “Hardware Configuration” part, are specified. In the first column of this part, the RMS value of the
                outputs of the device is specified.
                The maximum allowed value is determined in “Limits” section in “Test Object” page. In the second column,
                the phase of the output signals of the device is specified which can be between 0 to 360 degrees. Also,
                in the third column the frequency
                of the output signals of the device are specified which can be between 0 to 1.5 kHz. If DC signal is
                needed, the frequency should be specified as 0. / / / / In the “Bin. Out” section, the open/close state
                of “Binary Outputs” of the device
                is determined in accordance with the user’s wish. In the “Trigger” section, the conditions of “state”
                completion are determined which can be based on time, by pressing “space” button by the user and, also,
                based on receiving a specified
                signal from the relay or a combination of all three of these conditions. It is necessary to consider
                these two points: The first point is that in this section, it is possible to activate the related
                condition by double-clicking on any
                of the icons. To adjust the settings related to the “Inputs” you can do so from “Detail View” window or
                simply by checking “Trigger Condition” option. / The second point: these conditions have “OR” logic with
                each other. This means that
                if several conditions are met, if one of them is true, the current “state” ends. In the next section the
                type of “state” is determined which can be selected from the available drop-down list. Note that each of
                these types is described
                in “Detail View” section. In “Bin. Input” section, the momentarily receival state of signal on every
                activated binary inputs is specified. In the “Comment” section, any important note about each “state” is
                recorded by the user. Note that
                entering information in this section is only possible in “Detail View” page. / Right-click on “Table
                View” window RMS value column By right-clicking on any column of the “Table View” window, a list
                containing several options opens. Each
                of these options is designed for a specific purpose. After right-clicking on the column related to “RMS”
                value, by selecting “Nominal Value”, the amount of current and voltage in each cell is changed to
                specified nominal values in “Device”
                block in “Test Object” page. By selecting “Zero” it is possible to set the cell value to zero. If the
                user wishes the voltage or current in all three phases to be equal to the selected cell value, they can
                select the “Equal Magnitudes”
                option. Also by checking “Link Magnitude” option, the values of all three phases will be linked
                together. It should be noted that if two groups of voltage or current are activated from “Hardware
                Configuration”, you can see that the three
                phases of group A are linked together while the three phases of Group B are linked together. To better
                understand this, enter 2amps as the current for one of the phases of group A and enter 4amps as the
                current for one of the phases of
                group B. / / The “100% Load” option is used for changing the current to nominal value. The “50% Load”
                option is used for changing the current to half of the nominal value and the “Unloaded” option is used
                for changing the current to zero.
                Note that by selecting any of these options, the voltage is changed to the nominal value. If the user
                copies the values of voltage and current by right-clicking in “Vector View” window and selecting “Copy
                to Clipboard”, by selecting “Paste
                From Vector View Clipboard” in “Table View” window they can paste these values in their intended
                “state”. Also, by clicking on “L1L2L3-L3L1L2” option, the rotation of the phases as well as their values
                will change. / / “Link to XRio” option
                enables the user to relate the value of voltage, current, phase or frequency to any desired parameter in
                “XRio”. By selecting this option, “Link to XRio” window opens where the desired parameter can be
                selected. For example, in the “XRio”
                tree diagram in “Rio” section, in “Nominal Value” branch in “Device” block, the “In” parameter is
                selected. Also, it is possible to multiply the selected parameter by a specific value or add it to a
                specific value which is, finally, displayed
                in the box at the bottom. On the top right of this window it is possible to search a parameter. By
                checking “Filter by Sender Unit” on the left, all “XRio” parameters which have the same “unit” with the
                selected parameter in “Sequencer”
                are marked. / After linking the intended voltage, you can see that the selected cell is turned purple
                which indicates that this cell is linked with a value from the “XRio”. By selecting “Go to Linked
                Value”, it is possible to view that
                the selected parameter in “Sequencer” is linked with which parameter in “XRio”. If the user does not
                wish the parameter to be linked with “XRio”, it is possible to remove the link by selecting “Remove
                Link” option. / Phase column / By
                right-clicking on this column and selecting “Line Angle”, the angles of the selected voltage or current
                will equal with angle value of transmission line. It is possible to view and adjust this value in
                “Distance” block in “Test Object”
                page. By selecting “Zero”, it is possible to set the selected voltage or current to zero. If the user
                wishes to have the minimum amount of received current in the beginning of voltage injection, by
                selecting "90°" option, the phase of
                the injected voltage is set to 90 degrees. Balance Angle” option is selected for each cell, the related
                signal is selected as the reference signal and other phases are set at a degree with a 120 degrees,
                degree of difference with the reference
                signal. The “Reverse Rotation” option does the same in counterclockwise. This means that if this option
                is selected for a cell, regardless of its phase value, -120 degrees is Added to the next phase,
                respectively. By clicking on “Link
                angles Equals”, the angles of all three phases are equated and if one of them is changed, the others
                change accordingly. Also, the “Link angles Balance” option causes that if one of the phases is changed,
                the others change with a 120 degree
                difference. “Frequency” Column By selecting the “Nominal Value” from the options available for this
                column, the frequency value in each cell is changed to its nominal value in the “Device” block in the
                “Test Object” page. By selecting
                “DC”, the frequency is changed to zero and it is possible to produce “DC” signal. / If the user wishes
                all the frequency values to be equal, the “Equal Frequency” option can be used. By selecting this option
                for any cell, the frequency
                of other signals is set equal to the selected cell."Link Frequency" links all values of the frequencies
                with each other. This means that if one of the frequencies is changed, the other frequencies change the
                same amount as well and all
                the signals will always have the same frequency. If you need signals with different frequencies, you
                should uncheck this option. Decaying signal If you wish to create “DC” decaying signal, after setting
                the frequency to zero, it is possible
                to enter the time constant in the phase column. As you know, the relation of a decaying signal is
                written as “A*e^-t*T”. In this relation “A” is amplitude while “T” is the opposite of time constant.
                This means that the number you enter
                is the “T”. / /.

            <Search>ANALOG OUT TAB In the beginning of this video, we close the “Measurement View” window and change the
                size of other windows. In “State Type” section, the type of “State” is selected from the “State Type”
                dropdown field and in the “State Name”
                field a name Vebko is selected for the “State”. / In “Set Mode and Fault Type” section, the outputs of
                the device are specified according to parameters and types of faults. For example, in “Direct” mode, the
                output voltage and current
                of the device are determined directly but in “Line-Line” mode, the user specifies values of the line
                voltage and the zero sequence voltage, and the device produces the output voltage and current values in
                accordance with those other values.
                It should be noted that in this video, the instruction is done in “Direct” mode and descriptions about
                different “Set Modes” will be provided in future videos. / In “Binary Outputs” box, the state of binary
                Outputs of the device are specified
                where the user can enable or disable any binary according to the condition of the test. Moreover, from
                the “Binary Out” tab the user can adjust the settings related to binary Outputs in more details. / In
                “Binary Inputs” section, the state
                of active binaries of the device and the reception time of contact is specified. “Trigger setting”
                section: In “Comment” field, the user can add a note about the current “State”. This note is, also,
                viewable from the “Table View” window,
                “Comment” field. In “State Termination” section, the user determines the conditions for termination of
                the current “State” and initiation of the next “State”. In “Timeout” field, the signal injection time is
                determined by the user and
                after that the test ends or goes to the next “State”. / / / If the user wishes to specify conditions to
                terminate the current “State” according to reception of “Pickup” and “Trip” signals from the relay, they
                need to use the “Use binary
                trigger condition as specified below” option. To do this, first, the needed binaries should be enabled
                from the “Hardware Configuration” page. Then, in “Binary Trigger Condition” section, the condition of
                each binary for terminating the
                current “State” is specified. The conditions that the user can use are mentioned in the slide bar in
                front of each contact. Condition “0”, no contact has been received by the binary. Condition “1”, the
                binary, has received “Pick Up” or
                “Trip” contact. Condition “0 - 1”, the binary is first in “0” condition no contact received and then
                “Pick up” or “Trip” contact is received. In this condition, it is necessary for the binary to detect “0”
                to “1” signal. Condition “1 -
                0”, the binary is, at first, in condition “1” contact received and then the contact is removed from the
                binary. In this condition, it is necessary for the binary to detect “1” to “0” signal. Condition “1 -
                0”. “0 - 1”, if the binary detects
                any of the conditions “0 - 1” or “1 - 0”, the termination command of “State” is made. Condition “X”
                means there is no condition determined for “State” termination of this binary. It should be noted that
                if more than one condition is determined
                for “State” termination, the user needs to choose one logic from “AND” and “OR” logics from the “Trigger
                Logic” section to apply to the determined conditions. By using the “AND” logic, to terminate the “State”
                all conditions should be
                met while by using “OR” logic, if any of the conditions is met, the “State” is terminated. It should be
                noted that all this setting can be adjusted in “Binary Inputs” box by checking “Trigger Condition”. In
                this section in “Detail View”
                window, by checking “Show Time from this State” option, the contact reception time origin since the
                current “State” started is specified. Also, if you wish only for the last binaries state change to be
                displayed, check “Show only last
                change” and select one from among “1”, “0” and “0&1” radio-buttons in accordance with your needs. “0&1”
                option displays the last state of zero and one. It should be reminded that in the default mode of the
                software, if the binary is open
                circuited, it means that no contact is received and when the two ends of the binary are short circuited
                it means that contact has been received. This setting can be adjusted by changing the value of each
                binary from “True” to “False” in
                “Reverse” column of the “Hardware Configuration” page. / / For example, from the “Hardware
                Configuration” window and “Binary / Analog Input”, 6 binaries are selected with specific active
                “Targets”. Then, in “Trigger” section, the conditions
                of the binary are set at "0"، "1"،"1 ˃˗ 0"، 0 ˃˗ 1، 0 ˃˗ 1 . 1 ˃˗ 0 and X and “OR” is selected as the
                logic between them. In this case, by fulfilling any of condition, the current state is terminated but if
                “AND” logic is selected, all
                conditions must be fulfilled for the “State” to be terminated. Note that in “State Termination” section,
                between “Time Out”, “Space Key Press” and “Use Binary trigger condition as specified below” there is an
                “OR” logic and if they are
                selected simultaneously, if any of the conditions is fulfilled , the current “State” is terminated. By
                using “Trigger Logic Minimum Time”, the user specifies that how long the determined condition should
                last for the “State” to be terminated.
                It should be noted that this feature only works on conditions “1” and “0”. In the field related to
                “Delay after Binary Trigger”, the user makes a delay time between when the condition is fulfilled and
                when the “State” is terminated. For
                example, to simulate key performance delay, if 50 milliseconds is entered in this field, the current
                “State” is terminated after a 50 milliseconds delay and the key cutoff time is simulated. View videos of
                “Synchronizer Room” to see how
                “Synchronizer Mode” works. In “Other Setting” section, by checking “Disable Error Other”, errors of
                “Other” type are disabled in the current “State”. Also, by checking “Disable Error Overvoltage of
                Binary”, the “Overvoltage” errors of
                the analog binary inputs of the device are disabled in the current “State”. / In the "Error/Trigger
                Overcurrent" box a condition for the software overcurrent error or the termination of the state in case
                high current extraction is specified.
                By selecting "Overcurrent trigger" if the current extracted is more than 2A from the device, current
                state terminate. Therefore the software applies the next "state" and if it’s the last "state" the test
                ends without giving any error message.
                / In “Overcurrent” section, the user adjusts the settings related to “Overcurrent” error of the outputs
                of the voltage outputs. Note that the maximum current of each output is 400 milliamps and 2amps in
                transient state. In the field related
                to “Percent Error Overcurrent”, the maximum voltage output current is specified in percent and in the
                field related to “Threshold Error Overcurrent”, the maximum output current is specified as a number for
                the “Overcurrent” error. For
                example, if in the “Percent Error Overcurrent” field 90 percent is entered, if the output current of the
                device reaches to 90 percent of the voltage output current, which is 1.8 amps, the device errors. Also,
                if in the “Threshold Error
                Overcurrent” field, 1 amps is entered, as soon as the current drawn from the voltage outputs exceeds 1
                amps, the “Overcurrent” error is displayed and the test stops. “Disable Relay” section: Generally, the
                device works in a way that there
                are relays embedded behind all current and voltage outputs of the device. Before the test, all
                amplifiers of the device are off and all relays are open. By “Running” the test, the amplifiers turn on
                in 20 milliseconds, then, for 20 milliseconds
                the device produces a 60 volts voltage and 5 amps current and then examines that there is no
                “Self-calibration” error. After that, for 20 milliseconds, zero current and voltage are produced behind
                the current and voltage outputs. After
                these steps, the relays close. Now, after 100 milliseconds, the voltage and current of the test are
                created. By doing this before the test, the device is isolated from any outside voltage. Also, the
                amplifiers are off and the device is
                silent. By checking the box next to the title of every output in each “State”, the related relay opens
                and no more voltage or current is sent to the outputs. For example, to test “Magnetic Balance” of the
                transformer, it is necessary to
                open circuit some wiring in some state which it is done by disabling the relay of the related phase in
                the device.

        <contant id="Quick_Type">
            <Search>QUICK TYPE because “State Type: Quick” is very useful, for this “State Type”, there is a “Layout”
                named “Default Layout for Quick” designed for this “State Type” in “Window” menu. In this “Layout”,
                “Detail View”, “Signal View”, “Impedance
                View” and “Vector View” windows are located by default. / To describe this “State Type” and to view the
                outputs, it is better to maximize only “Detail View” and “Signal View” windows. In this “State Type” it
                is possible to, either manually
                or automatically, adjust the voltage and current signal output of the device in form of an increasing or
                decreasing ramp. In this “State Type” the user can create an increasing or decreasing ramp not only on
                the amplitude of signals but
                also on phase and frequency values. In “Analog Out” tab in “State Type” section, “Quick” is selected
                from the slide bar and in the “State Name” field, a name is selected for the intended “State”.
                Description about “State Type: Quick” is
                provided in “General: Direct “mode. In this mode, the voltage and current signals are initialized
                directly. To create an increasing or decreasing ramp on outputs of the device, information of “Analog
                Output Channels” and “Step Values”
                tables should be completed. “Analog Output Channels” table In this table the start value of signals is
                entered which indicates the start point of the ramp. This start value can be entered for all three
                parameters amplitude, phase and frequency
                of current or voltage. It should be noted that it is possible to use ramp on both voltage and current
                signals simultaneously. For example, the start values of voltage signals are “10”, “15”, and “20” volts
                and “2”, “3” and “4” amps for
                current signals. Other information related to “Analog Output Channels” has been described before. “Step
                Values” table In this table, the value of “Step” to increase or decrease signals is entered. In this
                table it is possible to enter
                the “Step” value for all three parameters amplitude, phase and frequency. This means that it is possible
                to increase or decrease all these parameters simultaneously with different or the same amplitudes. At
                the top of this table, by checking
                “Simple mode L1-L2-L3”, you will have the same steps for all three voltage or current phases. After
                checking this option in “Voltage” and “Current” sections, the parameter on which we wish to create a
                ramp is selected from the slide bar
                in the “Ramp on” section. Then, the “Step” value is entered in “Step Value” field. After unchecking
                “Simple modeL1-L2-L3”, in “Step Values” table, “1”, “2” and “3” volts are entered for voltage signals as
                ramp values while for current
                signals, “0.1”, “0.2” and “0.3” amps are entered as ramp values. By checking “Enable mouse wheel”
                option, if the cursor is on “Step Values” table, by using the mouse wheel, it is possible to increase or
                decrease the signal values and the
                specified steps simultaneously. This can be during or even before running the test. It should be noted
                that these changes are only possible if the ramp is set on “Manual” mode. “Quick Setting” section In
                this section by checking “Show
                Time from final step”, the time from the final step is displayed. One of the uses for this is in
                measuring the trip time of the relay. By checking “Clear Test after Start Edit” after running the test,
                if any changes are made to the test,
                without using the Clear test option, Information and setting can be altered. By checking the "Enable
                mouse wheel everywhere" option and holding the mouse pointer over the "Detail View" window, the values
                of the signals will increase or
                decrease with the specified steps if the mouse roller is rotated. If the mouse roller is turned upwards,
                the ramp will be incremental, and if it is rotated downwards, the ramp will be decreasing. This option
                is also used when the ramp
                is changed manually. If you also check the "Enable mouse wheel on step Table" option, the output values
                will change only by turning the mouse roller if the mouse pointer is on the "Step Values" table. By
                checking “Show Only Final Trip”
                option, the trip time is displayed by binary inputs of the last step. In “Time Out” field, the injection
                time of “State” is specified which is by default in set on “999” seconds in “Quick” mode. In “Quick”
                mode, the ramp is created either
                automatically or manually. After running the test if the “Manual” option is selected, the ramp is
                created manually and by clicking on “˄” and “˅” it is possible to create increasing or decreasing ramp.
                If during the test “Auto” option
                is selected, ramp is created automatically. In "∆t" field the time of each step is specified. By
                selecting “Up”, the ramp increases automatically and by selecting “Down” it decreases automatically. In
                “Enable Reset” field, it is possible
                to specify the reset time of signal value in a way that after checking this option during the test, the
                signal value is “Reset” for the specified period of time which is determined in “Reset” in “Reset
                Values” table. In this “State Type”
                it is possible to add information and results of the test to the output report by clicking on “Add to
                report” option. After clicking on this option, by opening the “State and Comment of Report” page, the
                settings related to the output
                report are adjusted. In the “Title” field, a title is entered for the output report and in “Show in
                Report” section from the “Quick” tree diagram, it is specified that what information are to be included
                in the output report. In “Comment”
                section, it is possible to add an additional comment or explanation for the report. In “Custom Image”
                section, you can add an image to the report. In this report, it is the user who determines whether the
                test was successful or not by
                clicking on “Passed” option for success and “Failed” option for failure of the test. Then, the result is
                included in the report which can be viewed in the “Report View” window. By clicking on
                “Edit.Delete.Report” option, the “Delete from
                Report” window opens where it is possible to edit or delete the added reports. It is done by selecting
                the intended report and clicking on “Edit Selected Report” to edit the report and then clicking on
                “Passed” or “Fail”. It is, also,
                possible to delete a report by clicking on “Delete Selected Report”. In the row of every report there
                are columns like “Trip Time”, “Detail View”, etc. which are added to the report if “True” is selected as
                their value but “False” is selected,
                they are removed from the output report. By clicking on “Swap” at the top of the page, “Quick Setting”
                and “Ramp Termination” sections are swapped. This is done, according to the user's need, to show the
                "Ramp Termination" section. In
                “Ramp Termination” section, the conditions for terminating the “Ramp” are specified. The difference
                between this section and “State Termination” is that here the signal injection is continued and only
                step change of signals is terminated
                but in “State Termination” after the condition is met, the “State” is terminated. The termination
                conditions of “Ramp” are just like “Trigger Setting” which has been described in previous videos. By
                selecting “Reset Value”, it is possible
                to adjust the “Reset” value for voltage and current signals in “Reset Values” table so if “Apply Reset”
                is selected during the test, the values of voltage and current signals change to the specified “Reset”
                values. This feature is useful
                in tests like “Minimum Voltage to Operate Circuit breaker. By clicking on “Apply Zero”, the values of
                voltage and current signals are changed to zero. By clicking on “Hold Value”, the values of voltage and
                current signals remain as they
                are and do not change. The information related to "Trigger Setting" has been described in previous
                videos. By selecting "Offset Value", it is possible to give an offset to the signal in the "Offset
                Value" table. For example it is possible
                to give a value of "DC=10" volts to "VLE-1" signal or even give a value of decaying "DC" to the initial
                voltage. It is also possible to add a harmonic offset to the initial signal by changing the frequency.
                After repeating the test, all
                changes made along with their time are displayed in “Changes” section. “Disable Relay” section has been
                described in previous videos.

                window is maximized too so you can view the outputs. In the “Signal View” window, the signal view type
                is set on “RMS” mode, “Digital” signals
                are disabled and, to have a better view of the signals, the signals are turned “Bold”. / / / In this
                “State Type”, it is possible to set the voltage and current outputs of the device to increasing or
                decreasing “Ramp. This “State Type”
                is used when the user wishes to get a threshold for a parameter. It should be mentioned that it is
                possible to apply this “Ramp” to amplitude, phase and frequency or a combination of these options for
                voltage and current signals. / It
                should be noted that, to better understand the concept of “Step Ramp”, only “General: Direct” mode is
                explained. Creating a “Ramp” output requires three values: start value, step value and final value. /
                “Start Values” table In this section,
                the start value of “Ramp” is specified and it indicates that from what point the “Ramp” should start.
                These values can be specified for the three parameters of amplitude, phase and frequency separately. For
                example, values of voltage in
                this section are set at 5, 10 and 15 volts. “Binary Output”, “Binary Input” and “Other Setting” sections
                are explained in previous videos and will not be mentioned here. / “Step Values” section In “Step
                Values” section, the value for every
                “Step” is specified. These values can be specified for the three parameters of amplitude, phase and
                frequency separately. For example, the value of “Step” for voltage is set at 1, 2 and 2 volts. / “Final
                Values” section In this section,
                the final value of the ramp signal is specified which indicates that at what point should the ramp
                finish. These values can be specified for the three parameters of amplitude, phase and frequency
                separately. The final value of voltage
                in this section is 20, 25 and 30 volts. / You can see that the signal of all three voltage phases has
                reached from the start value to the final value, according to the specified steps, in form of a “Ramp”.
                In the “Time Setting” box in
                “Step Ramp Setting” section, the time of each step is specified. This value is 500 milliseconds by
                default. By checking the “Enable Reset” option, it is possible to allow the signals to “Reset” after a
                specific time period. In “Reset Time”
                section, the time of each “Reset” step is specified which is added to the “State” time. To set the value
                and its parameter you should go to the bottom of the page in “Reset Values” section. This section and
                “Disable Relay” section has
                already been described in previous videos. / There are two options in the “Ramp Type” section where the
                first option, which is “Step Values”, is active by default. By selecting this option, the settings are
                as described before. As you
                can see, for example in L1 phase, each “Step” is increased by 1 volt every 500 milliseconds but by
                selecting “Rate Value per Second”, the number of steps specified in the “Step Values” table is
                determined as value per second. For example,
                L1 phase should increase by 1 volt every second. According to the specified “Step Time”, every second,
                there will be two 500millivolts step. / In “Ramp Description Errors” section, steps of the “Ramp”, the
                total time of the “State” and
                the errors are described. By using the “Simple Mode” option, it is possible to specify the value of
                steps of the “Ramp” and the final value of the “Ramp” more easily. By checking the “Simple Mode” option,
                the settings of “Step Values”
                and “Final Values” table are disabled and a new section including voltage and current sections are
                opened. In these sections, first, the parameter is selected from the slider bar. This slider bar
                includes amplitude, phase and frequency
                options. After selecting the parameter, two options are displayed. In the “Step Value” and “Final Value”
                fields, the step value of the “Ramp” and the final value of the “Ramp” are specified respectively. The
                difference between this option
                and the previous state is that in this state all three phases change simultaneously. / / An important
                point in “Ramp” on frequency is that there will be signal jump. So, it is possible that while testing
                the frequency relays, an appropriate
                response is not received from the relay; while “Ramping” on a frequency, to keep the signal steady, it
                is necessary to check the “Continuous in Frequency Step”. By specifying 2Hz as the start value of
                frequency and 3Hz as the “Step Ramp”
                and 50Hz as the final value, there will be a frequency jump in the output signal. To view this frequency
                jump, first, the output signal must be set on “Inst”. As you can see, by checking “Continuous in
                Frequency Step”, this frequency jump
                disappears.

        <contant id="Continuous_Ramp_Type">
            <Search>CONTINUOUS RAMP TYPE This “State Type” is similar to “Step Ramp”. The only difference is that in
                “Step Ramp” the parameter changes step by step at user-defined time intervals but in “Continuous Ramp”,
                the parameters increase or decrease continuously
                with 400 microseconds time steps. / The parameters adjusted for “Continuous Ramp” include start value,
                final value and total time and the start values are specified in “Start Values” table. Here, the values
                for voltage signals are 5, 10
                and 15 volts. “Binary Output”, “Binary Input” and “Other Setting” sections have been described before
                and we can skip them. In “Final Values” table the final value of the parameters is specified. Here, the
                values for voltage signals are
                20, 25 and 30 volts. / / In “Total Time” field in the “Continuous Ramp Setting” section the total time
                of the “State” is specified which is linked with the “Timeout” time in “State Termination” in “Trigger”
                setting. “Trigger”, “Offset
                Value”, “Error/Trigger Overcurrent” and “Disable Relay” sections have been described in previous videos
                and more descriptions should not be necessary here. / Another important matter about “Ramp” is that, in
                addition to put ramp on voltage
                and current, in “Step Ramp” the user can put ramp on impedance by changing the “Set Mode”. Since the
                hardware is only capable of recognizing voltage and current and cannot recognize the impedance
                parameter, and because there are so many
                impedance parameters, it is not possible to send these parameters to the hardware in every “Step”. So,
                in “Step Ramp” firstly all values of impedance steps are sent to the software and then measured voltage
                and current sent to the hardware
                as an array every time “Step” in “Continuous Ramp” is 400 microseconds, the amount of calculations and
                arrays is greatly increased and it is not possible for the results of the calculations and created
                arrays to be sent to the hardware.
                So, this “State Type” is always carried out in “General: Direct” mode. / /

                window, the "Signal View" window is also magnified to observe outputs. As you are aware, based on the
                Fourier series expansion, a periodic
                signal can be expressed in terms of the sum of several sinusoidal waves with various coefficients and
                frequencies. In "Harmonic" State Type, the user can inject voltage signals and harmonic current
                by"AMT105" device. To this purpose, in
                "Detail View" window, "Analog Out" tab and "State Type" part, the "Harmonic" State Type is selected from
                dropdown field. As can be observed, in this"State Type", the user can create and inject a signal with
                two desired harmonics. To this
                purpose, first the signal data or main harmonic should be entered in "Analog Output Channels" and the

                of each signal. It is noteworthy that the harmonic voltage and current signals can be simultaneously
                injected by device. For example,
                the data of three balanced voltage signals with an amplitude of "50" V and a frequency of "50" Hz, and
                three balanced current signals with an amplitude of "500" milliampere mA and a frequency of "50" Hz are

        <contant id="Transient_state_type">
            <Search>THE “TRANSIENT” STATE TYPE: As mentioned before, one of the features of Vebko device and software is
                relay testing in transient state. To easily access the windows needed for this “State Type”, a “Layout”
                named “Default Layout for Transient”
                is designed specifically for this state which is located in the “Windows” menu. This layout includes
                “Detail View”, “Signal View”, “Measurement View”, “Vector View” and “Impedance View” windows. Here, to
                have a better view of the “Detail
                View” window, all other windows is closed. When a fault occurs, the relay saves the fault information
                and moments before the fault as a “Comtrade” file and provides the user with this file. By using this
                information it is possible to view
                impedance or differential trajectory or by injecting the same transient signal, simulate the fault
                moment and test the relay performance again. / / Other than “Comtrade” file with “cfg” extension, there
                is another file with “dat” extension.
                These two files have the same name and for the “comtrade” file to be loaded in the software, both files
                must be together. In “Transient Setting” section, the settings related to “comtrade” file are adjusted.
                By selecting “Import Comtrade”,
                the “comtrade” file exported from the relay is imported and loaded. Moreover, a list including several
                “comtrade” files is located in the software. By selecting “Import Comtrade from List” option this list
                opens and a file can be selected
                and loaded. After loading a transient file, the data related to that file is loaded in the table of this
                section. In “Signal” column, name of the output of the device is specified. To change the outputs of
                this section, “Analog Out” tab
                in the “Hardware Configuration” page can be used. In “Channel” column, current or voltage signals
                allocated to output of the device are displayed. By opening the drop down field, it is possible to
                change the allocated signal. / / In “Scale”
                column, the user can determine a specific percentage of the Transient signal amplitude for injection. In
                “Min” and “Max” columns, positive and negative amplitudes of signals of “Comtrade” file are specified.
                In “Pirm.factor” and “sec.factor”
                columns, the conversion ratio of “VT”s and “CT”s is specified in relation to the “Comtrade” file and it
                is possible that values of these coefficients are not the some in some files. In that case, the user
                needs to edit them. For example,
                here “Prim.factor” is set at 1 kilovolt and by right-clicking on this column and selecting “Apply to all
                Voltage”, this value is set for other voltages as well. / In “PS” column, it is specified that the
                information of “Comtrade” is primary
                or secondary side. If it is “Primary”, in “Min” and “Max” columns the secondary values are placed in
                “Prim.factor” and “Sec.factor” in accordance with the given conversion ratio. If “Secondary” is
                selected, in “Min” and “Max” columns,
                the original values of the file are placed. To calculate the “RMS” value of the signals of “Comtrade”
                file and displaying it in “Signal View”, first, “Calculate RMS, Phase and Other” option should be
                checked and then in “Setting” tab,
                in “Show Type” box, the “RMS” radio button is checked. After seeing signal's "RMS" value, "show type" is
                get back to the instantaneous state. / / By checking “Select All Channel” in “Channel” column, it is
                possible to select all voltage
                and current signals existent in the “Comtrade” file for outputs of the device while if this option is
                unchecked, in the list of every output, it is possible to only select signals from the same type of
                output. For example, in “VL1-E” output,
                only voltage signals of the “Comtrade” file are visible. The reason for the existence of this option is
                that in some transient files, the unit of signals is not given in volt and ampere and the software is
                not able to differentiate between
                current and voltage and allocate it to the output of the device. So, it is necessary for the user to
                manually introduce the voltage and current signals to outputs of the device. / / If the user wishes to
                view the waveform of all voltage,
                current and digital signals existent in the “Comtrade” file in “Signal View”, he should select “Current
                State” from the toolbar. Then from the “Setting” tab in “Signal View”, he should select the signals that
                he wishes to view. But in
                “All State” state, it is only possible to view the waveform of the outputs of the device in each “State”
                and not the waveform of all signals in “Single View”. To better analyze the transient signals in “Vector
                View” window, it is possible
                to open up to 5 “Vector Views” and, view the vector of different signals in different times.
                Complementary description about “Vector View” window will be provided in the videos related to this
                window. / / / / If the current and voltage
                values allocated to the output of the device which are specified in “Max” and “Min” columns exceed the
                allowed injection amount of the device, an error message is recorded in the “Errors” section. By
                selecting the “Limit Voltage and Current
                of Transient File to Setting”, the amplitude of these signals is limited to the injectable amount by the
                device. The difference between this option and “Scale” is that by selecting this option, a part of the
                signal amplitude which is exceeding
                the allowed amount is cut but in “Scale”, only a coefficient is multiplied by signal amplitude and no
                part of the signal is cut. The name of the “Comtrade” file is written in “File Name” section. / By
                right-clicking on “Prim. Factor” column
                or “Sec. Factor” and selecting “Fill Primary Secondary from Device” option, the “Prim. Factor” and
                “Sec.factor” values are entered in the “Test Object” page from “Device” block and if “Fill Primary
                Secondary from Comtrade File” is selected,
                the values of this column are entered from the “Comtrade” file. In “Sampling Rate” section, the
                information related to sampling frequency of the device and “Comtrade” file is specified. In “Original”
                field, the original value of the signal
                sampling frequency, in “Used” field, the value of used sampling frequency to be displayed in “Signal
                View” window and in “Frequency” section, the test signal frequency is specified. / / / If the user
                wishes to apply a part of the transient
                waveform to the device, he can use the “Trim Time” section where its start time is specified in “Start
                Time” section and the end time is specified in “End Time” section. In this section, when the “Comtrade”
                file is loaded, the time value
                is extracted from the “Comtrade” file. To inject a part of the transient signal by device, first, the
                “Current State” option should be selected. Then, by activating “Cursor1” and “Cursor2” in “Setting” of
                the “Signal View” window, the
                beginning and end of the signal is specified. Finally by clicking on “Apply from trackbars” option, the
                values of “Cursors” are entered automatically. Also by selecting “Reset Time” option, these times reset.

            <Search>THE “TRANSIENT” STATE OBSERVING THE IMPEDANCE TRAJECTORY One of the applications of “State Type”
                Transient” is that the impedance and differential trajectories of distance and differential relays could
                be observed. The meaning of trajectory
                is the route of the change of differential or impedance characteristic of differential and distance
                relays in their characteristic curves based on the injected waves to the relay. For this purpose, at
                first, from the “window” menu, the
                “Default Layout for Transient” option will be selected so the arrangement of the windows would change.
                In this arrangement, the “Detail View”, “Signal View”, “Vector View” and “Impedance View” windows are
                positioned that is used for observing
                the trajectory. / / In the following, the “Detail View” window will be selected from the “State Type”
                drop down field of the “Transient” state. Then, the “current State” option will be selected from the
                toolbar on the upper part of the
                page. By doing this, the signals related to “State Type” in the “Signal View” and “Vector View” will be

                distance relay. / To do so,
                the “Test Object” icon will be clicked so the “General Test Object” would be opened. On this page, by
                having “XRio” ad “Rio” files of the relay, the data of the relay would be entered in two ways. In this
                video, the data are loaded using
                the “Rio”. To do so, we will click on the “Import from File” option, the file of “Rio” of the distance
                relay will be selected and loaded, and the OK option will be clicked. After loading the relay data, the
                impedance characteristic relay
                will be displayed in the “Impedance View”. / / / Entering the “Comtrade” file After entering the relay
                information, the transient state file that is extracted from the relay should be loaded in the software.
                As you know, the “Comtrade”
                output is two files with the format of “CFG” and “DAT”. If these two files are not located in a folder,
                then, this file will not be loaded in the software. To do this, click on the “Import Comtrade” option
                and then the intended file will
                be selected and loaded. Note that if the “Rio” has the same name as the “Comtrade” file and is located
                in a folder, by loading the “Comtrade” file, the data of the “Rio” file will be loaded automatically.
                After loading the “Comtrade” file,
                the voltage and current signals will be displayed in “Signal View” and the information of voltage and
                the current signal will be displayed in the “Detail View” window. “Calculate RMS…” should be checked to
                the software calculates the RMS
                and phase of the voltage and current signals to trajectory display. After this, in the “Signal View”
                window, the “Setting” tab, the “cursor” option will be checked. After activating the “Cursor”, the
                impedance trajectory could be observed
                online in the “Impedance View” by moving the “Cursor 1” in the time axis of “signal View” window. Note
                that for the differential relays “Comtrade” files, six current phases and for distance relays “Comtrade”
                files, three current phases
                and three voltage phases should active. Also, you have to check that the assigned signals to each output
                to be exactly according to the state that exists in the real state and in case of difference, it should
                be manually modified. / /
                / / / / / The “Impedance View” window As mentioned in the “Impedance View” window, the impedance or
                differential characteristic curve of the relays is displayed. By opening this window, the impedance
                characteristic curve is displayed by
                default. This curve displays the line impedance in terms of “R” and “X”. In the “Impedance View”, select
                the “Differential” icon from the left-side icons for displaying the differential characteristic curve,
                so the differential characteristic
                curve of the differential relay would be displayed. This curve will be explained more in the
                differential trajectory video. / / In the “Impedance View” window, by clicking on the “Undo” or “Redo”
                icons, we can return to the previous or
                next changes that are done on the characteristic curve. The “Zoom Model” icon places the mouse cursor in
                the zoomed condition for magnifying a part of the characteristic curve. The “Optimize all” icon will
                show the characteristic curve
                shape as a complete curve. The “Zoom In” and “Zoom Out” icons are used for magnifying and zoom out the
                characteristic curve. Using the “Pan Mode” icon, the characteristic curve could be displaced. By
                clicking on the “Hide/ Show Toolbox”
                the existing icons in the “Toolbox” could become hidden and shown again. Using the “Fault Type” icon the
                fault display can be specified. By clicking on the “Export CSV” from the settings of the relay zones
                that are checked, a “CSV” format
                output could be saved. Please pay attention that one CSV file will be given for each zone. / / / / / / /
                / By clicking on the existing gear wheel in the below of this window, some options will be displayed for
                a better trajectory. By checking
                the “Between Orange, Green” option, the trajectory will be displayed as a line that its waves are
                between the orange and green colors in the “signal View”. As a result, the trajectory will be displayed
                between these two “cursors”. By checking
                the “all Points” option, the trajectory will be displayed in all the points and at all the times of the
                “Comtrade” file. In the “Circle.Ref” field, it will be specified that the trajectory will be
                simultaneously displayed by displacing
                which cursor on the “Signal View”. Here, by changing the “Cursor” to orange the trajectory changes could
                be observed. The “ZL1E”, “ZL2E”, “ZL3E”, “ZL1L2”, “ZL2L3” and “ZL3L1” options show the impedance
                trajectory in different faults. The
                display of the trajectory of that fault can be deleted from the characteristic curve by unchecking each
                of them. In the below of each of these options, the coordinates of the impedance point is displayed as
                the “R” and “X” as online by
                moving the “Cursor 1” in “Signal View”. / / For observing the amounts of voltage and current at each
                moment, in the “Vector View” window of the “Type” field, the “Orange” option should be checked that is
                related to orange-colored “Cursor”.
                Then, the voltage and current values and also the trajectory variations could be observed online by

            <Search>THE "TRANSIENT" STATE OBSERVING THE DIFFERENTIAL TRAJECTORY As already said, one of the functions of
                the "State Type: Transient" is to observe the impedance and differential trajectories of distance and
                differential relays. The route trajectory
                signifies the variation of differential or impedance characteristic curve in differential or distance
                relays based on the injected wave shapes. To this purpose, at first, from the "Default Layout for
                Transient" option is selected from
                the "Window" menu, so the arrangement of windows change proportionally to this test run. In this
                arrangement, the "Detail View", "Signal View", "Vector View" and "Impedance View" are located in a way
                to observe the trajectory. / / Subsequently,
                the "Transient" state is selected from the "Detail View" window from the "State Type" slider field.
                Remember for "Comtrade" files of the differential relay six current phases, three current phases and
                three voltage phases must be active
                for "Comtrade" files of distance relay. Also, examine if the assigned signal to each output matches
                exactly the real condition and in case of any differences you have to correct it manually. At first, six
                current phases are activated in
                the "Hardware Configuration" window and the voltage phases are deactivated. / / Simultaneous importing
                of the "Comtrade" file and relay information In this video, the objective is to import the relay
                information and "Comtrade" file simultaneously.
                This case happens when the "Comtrade" and "Rio" files of the relay have an identical name and saved in
                one folder. Then, click on the "Import Comtrade" option and the "Comtrade" file of the "7ut613"
                differential relay is selected. After

                are loaded simultaneously and
                in case of selecting "NO", the "Rio" file won't be loaded and the relay information should be loaded
                separately. In this video, after clicking on the "YES" option, the "Rio" and "Comtrade" files are loaded
                simultaneously. After loading
                the "Comtrade" file, the "Detail View" window should be checked to see if the assigned signals to the
                current outputs accommodate the real condition or not. In this table, the "3I0" signal is imported
                instead of the "IL1-M2" signal that
                is not correct. Therefore, in the "Channel" column, the IL1 1 slider field is right-clicked and the

                respectively. Then, from the toolbar on
                the top of the page, the “Current State" option is selected. By doing this, the signals related to
                "State Type" is displayed in the "Signal View" and "Vector View" after importing the "Comtrade" file. /
                / / / Subsequently, click on the
                "Differential" icon on the "Impedance View" window, so the characteristic curve of the differential
                relay is displayed. This curve is based on "I bias" and "I diff" that are bias current and differential
                current, respectively. Remember
                by selecting the "Differential" curve, proportionally, the name of the window is changed to
                "Differential Characteristic". After this, the "Cursor" option is checked in the "Setting" tab in the
                "Signal View" window. Do not forget to check
                “Calculate RMS…” option which displays the differential trajectory. After activating the "Cursor", by
                moving the "Cursor 1" over the time axis in the "Signal View" window, the differential trajectory could
                be observed instantly in the
                "Differential Characteristic" window. By checking the "All Point" option, the differential trajectory is
                displayed in all the time of the "Comtrade" file. Other options of the "Differential Characteristic"
                window are similar to the "Impedance

            <Search>“TRACKING” STATE In "State Type: Tracking", power swing test or "power swing blocking" of distance
                relays is done. Power swing protection or "power swing blocking" is performed at the level of power
                transmission network. In order to conduct
                "Power Swing Blocking" test, after selecting "State Type: Tracking", the "Impedance View" window should
                be opened to display the impedance characteristic of relay, because in vebko software, this test is
                conducted by impedance characteristic.
                / / / The power swing blocking test is usually conducted in three-phase fault and "Z-I const." mode.
                That is why in "Fault Type" field, the fault type has been selected to be "L1-L2-L3" by default. In "Z-I
                const." mode, the test current
                is constant and different voltages are generated to create fault impedance. "Analog Output Channels"

                by adjusting the fault impedance
                value, the test current value is calculated using mathematical relations and displayed in "Table View".
                Additionally, in"Distance: Z-Zs const" mode, the value of fault impedance and "SIR" parameter value,
                which is the ratio of source impedance
                to fault impedance, are adjusted and the values of current and test voltage are calculated using
                mathematical relations and are displayed in "Table View". / / / Now if user wants to consider the fault
                impedance in terms of a percentage
                of a parameter, he can use three modes: "Distance: Z%-I const"، "Distance: Z%-V const", and"Distance:
                Z%-Zs const. " in the "% of" part, it has been determined that fault impedance should be selected as a
                percentage of line impedance.
                In the "Z%" part, it is determined that what percentage of the selected value the fault impedance should
                be, and in "phiZ" part, the impedance angle is adjusted. / In "Distance: Z%-I const" mode, the fault
                current is constant and the software
                calculates its corresponding voltage and current based on the fault type and impedance. In addition, the
                value of fault voltage is constant in "Distance: Z%-V const", and when the user adjusts it, the test
                current values are calculated
                by software. Additionally, by adjusting "SIR" parameter in "Distance: Z%-V const" mode, the value of
                current and test voltage is calculated in software. It should be noted that the current and test voltage
                values are also calculated using
                the above mentioned formulas with the difference that the impedance value is selected to be a percentage
                of the line impedance. For example, in "Distance: Z%-Zs const" mode, the impedance test point is
                selected to be 80% of the line impedance
                with a 40° angle and "SIR" value is adjusted to be 10. Now the values of voltage and test current are
                calculated using the above mentioned mathematical relations and displayed in "Table View". / If user
                wants to conduct "OverCurrent" test
                in this room, he should adjust "Set Mode" on "Overcurrent: ITest" and adjust current, current angle, and
                voltage for directional functions in "Analog Output Channels" table. In "Table View" page, the values of
                voltage and test current
                are calculated based on the selected "Fault Type". For example, for two phase fault "L1-L2", the test
                current of 1 A with a 40° angle and voltage of 5 V was adjusted and the values of current and test
                voltage can be observed in "Table
                View". / / Additionally, in order to test differential relays in this room, the user should open
                "Hardware Configuration" window and disable the voltage outputs and enable all 6 current phases. Then in
                "Detail View" window adjust the "Set
                Mode" on "Differential: IBias, Idiff". By adjusting "IDiff" and"IBias" values to be 0.5 and 7 times of
                the nominal current in "Analog Output Chnnels" table, the current of different phases is calculated for
                differential function and displayed
                in "Table View" window. Pay attention that these values are calculated based on the parameters adjusted
                in "Differential" block of "Test Object" page, and the user is required to enter the specifications of
                the protected equipment and
                tested relay. / /

            <Search>ADDITIONAL SETTINGS OF “DETAIL VIEW” “Continue Last State Amplitude” Option: This option appears in

                or voltage value of the current State
                is injected from where the previous “State” is finished. This option is used to measure the relay trip
                time or “Pickup Drop off” test in relays. For example, in “Pickup Drop off” test an increasing “Step
                Ramp State” is created where three-phases
                2amps to 4amps current increases with 0.2amp steps and “Trigger” condition for reception of “Pickup”
                signal is specified. Note that “Binary Input 2” is specified for “Pickup” signal reception. / / / The
                second “State” is a decreasing “Step
                Ramp” where three-phases 4amps to 2amps current decreases with 0.2amp steps and “Trigger” condition of
                “Dropping” the relay 1-0 is specified. After performing the test, you can see that after receiving the
                “Pickup” contact, the second
                “State” starts decreasing from 4amps until the relay “Drops”. But if you check the “Continue Last State
                Amplitude” option in “State2” and perform the test, after receiving the “Pickup” signal, the current in
                the second “State” starts decreasing
                from where the relay performed the “Pickup” and keeps doing so until the relay performs the “Drop”. / /
                / / “Disable Get Actual” Option If you check the “Show Actual Value” option in “Hardware Configuration”
                window, the “Disable Get Actual”
                option appears in “Detail View” window. By checking this option, the actual current or voltage value
                will not be displayed in that “State”. If there are two “States” and the injection time in a “State” is
                too long and you do not want to
                view the actual value, by checking the “Disable Get Actual” option in “Detail View” window, the actual
                value will not be displayed in that “State”. / / “Disable Relay” option In the back of every voltage or
                current output of the device
                there are relays which separate the “Amplifier” section of the inside of the device from the front
                panel. Before performing the test these relays must be connected and then the voltage or current is
                injected from the outputs of the device.
                In “Disable Relay” section in “Detail View” window, by checking any of the options available in the
                list, it is possible to disable the relay related to that output and then after performing the test you
                can see that the actual output
                value of the intended port equals zero. This option is used in tests such as magnetic flux division in
                transformer because by using this option, it is possible to create different modes of open circuit of
                coils for the test automatically.
                / To perform tests such as transformer wiring resistance test which needs a long time to charge the
                winding of the transformer, the current starts increasing from zero and during this time, because of the
                difference between the specified
                current and the actual current injected by the device, there is error Other. So to make the test
                practical it is necessary to disable the error “Other” so that the test can continue. Also, in this
                test, it is possible that huge voltage
                peaks occur momentarily; therefore to avoid stopping the test, the “Overvoltage” error of the binary
                needs to be disabled as well. The last option on this page is “Start Time Ref. From This State”. To
                better understand the function of
                this option, suppose that there are two “States” and the first one is “330” milliseconds while the
                second is “35” milliseconds. Normally, the first “State” is followed by the second “State” and the
                signal is continuous. In this example,
                if you zoom on the border of the two “States” in “Signal View”, you can view the continuity of the
                signal. In this case, the time reference to determine the phase of the signals is the first “State”.
                This is why even though in the second
                “State” the “Il1” current phase is zero, its signal does not begin from zero. Now, by checking “Start
                Time Ref. From This State” option, you can see that the time reference of the second “State” is changed
                and considered from the beginning
                of this “State”.

                can use the "view" menu, the "signal
                view" option, or the tool bar, "signal view" icon. The output voltage and current signals as well as the
                status of the device "binaries" are shown in this window. In "setting" tab, this window setting is
                performed. / / / Right clicks of
                "signal view" window In order to zoom in or out along horizontal axis, click on "zoom" option and use
                Zoom In + and Zoom Out -, respectively. Here, “Plus” is used to Zoom In +. In addition, you can also use
                the + and - keys on the keyboard
                or the Scroller. In order to zoom along vertical axis, hold down Ctrl and roll the mouse wheel. By doing
                this, you can zoom in on the voltage diagram of group "A" and along "y" axis. This can also be done by
                holding down the Ctrl key of
                the keyboard and using the + and - keys. Using "Optimize" option, the diagram display can be optimized.
                If the user intends to optimize the curves along horizontal axis, the "Optimize X-Axis" option or the X
                shortcut key of keyboard can
                be used. If one intends to optimize the curves along vertical axis, they should use the "Optimize
                Y-Axis" option, or the shortcut Y on the keyboard. If the "Optimize all" option is selected, the whole
                curve is displayed within the specified
                time, and the diagrams are optimized in terms of both "x" and "y" axes. In the "view" option, you can
                zoom in on the given diagram along "Y" axis, for example the voltage diagram of "A" group is set
                on"100". Additionally, some values have
                been written beside the coefficients of this list that are used to apply changes using the keyboard
                buttons. Here, for example, it is observed that this diagram is shown along "Y" axis twice magnified
                using voltage "A" group diagram and
                by pressing "2" on the keyboard. In "signals" option, the displayed signals are shown in the
                corresponding diagram. From this part, the user can hide the signal curve in the selected diagram by
                unchecking the desired signal. For example
                here the "V L1-E" signal is hidden in the diagram. Additionally, the user can also hide or show that
                signal in the diagram by holding down "shift" key on the keyboard by clicking on the desired signal
                name. For example, by holding down
                "shift" and clicking on the "VL1-E" signal name, this signal can be added to the diagram. The "bold"
                option is used to make the signals displayed on the diagram thicker, for example here by checking "V
                L2-E", it can be observed that its
                signal become "bold"; moreover, the line next to the signal name becomes "bold". By holding down "Ctrl"
                key and clicking on the desired signal name, it can be displayed in "bold" state or the user can leave
                this state. For example, by
                holding down the "Ctrl" and clicking on the "VL2-E"signal name, this signal leaves the bold state.
                Remember the options "View", "Signals", and "Bold" act differently for each diagram, for example, by
                right clicking on group "A" voltage
                diagram and adjusting the "view" on 200%, it is observed that the height of relevant voltage diagram
                increases by 200%, but the height of the current outputs of group "A" diagram remains unchanged.
                Additionally, by right clicking on the
                group "A" voltage diagram and by opening "signal" and "Bold" options, it can be seen that only group "A"
                voltage signals are shown. So if you want to use the "View", "Signals", and "Bold" capabilities for
                current outputs of "A" group,
                you should right click on the current diagram of group "A" and apply the required changes. In the
                "diagram" option, the list containing all signals exists and the given signal can be selected to be
                displayed in "signal view". Please consider
                that here the signals used in test and enabled from "Hardware Configuration" can be selected. The group
                "A" voltage outputs, group "A" current outputs, and the device binaries have been selected by default to
                be displayed in the "signal
                view". For further explanation, first go to "Hardware Configuration" to enable all voltage and current
                outputs of the device; now if the "Voltage all" option is selected, all voltage outputs of groups "A"
                and "B" are shown in a diagram.
                Moreover, if the "Current all" option is selected, all current outputs of groups "A" and "B" are shown
                in a diagram. If the user wants to have each of the voltage and current outputs in a separate diagram,
                that signal should be enabled
                here by checking it. For example the "IL1" and "IL2" signals are checked. It is observed that each of
                the "IL1" and "IL2" signals are displayed in separate diagrams. Additionally, if the user needs to
                display the current outputs of group
                "B" in a diagram, the "current Group B" should be selected from this part. Each signal can be added to
                or removed from this window in this way. If the user has made any changes in the way of displaying
                signal lines, hiding signal, adding
                or reducing signal, etc., by clicking on "Default View" option, all settings in this window will be
                restored to default and the applied changes are removed.

                is used for calculating the “RMS”
                value based on the average number of several periods. As the number groes up, the longer it will take,
                while the accuracy increases and there will be less fluctuations. By selecting “Live Scroll”, you can
                easily observe the voltage or
                current signal changes at any moment of the injection and the instantaneous signal changes. In order to
                see this, a test will run on the zoomed signal and you can always observe the moment of injecting the
                signal. By selecting “Highlight
                Current State”, a part of the signal related to the current “State” is specified. In order to see this,
                if another State is added, a part of the signal related to the current State will be highlighted. “Show
                Time On Binary” displays the
                time related to disconencting or connecting the output and input binaries to “Digital” graph. For
                observing it, run the test , on which the time is shown by connecting and disconencting the “C3” binary.
                / In “Show Table”, the settings
                related to “Cursors” and “Data Table” are made. First, you should enable Cursor and Data Table by
                selecting them at the top of the table. In this table, up to three “Cursors” can be enabled in “Cursor”
                column and Data Table can be used
                for analyzing the signals. Remember to show the data in each “Cursor” in “Data Table” the related “Data
                Table” column should be checked. In addition, three other rows specific to the difference between “C1”,
                “C2” and “C3” cursors can be
                enabled or disabled in “Data Table” column. After enabling “Cursor” and “Data Table” at the top of the
                table, you will see a table and two “Trackbars” added to “Signal View” window.”Time” column represents
                the time when the “Cursor” is
                on it. In “Signal” column, a signal is dedicated to “Cursor”. “Value” column represents the signal
                value, “RMS” column represents the effective signal value, “ Phase “ column shows the signal angle and
                in “ Frequency “column, the test
                frequency is displayed. / In “Extra Setting”, “Cursor” attaches to the moment of receiviong the digital
                signal and increases the reading accuracy by “Snap” while “Cursor” is enabled and by approaching
                “Cursor” to the moment of recording
                the digital signal. In “Extra Options” and “Num. Of Points” field, the number of sampling points from
                the signal is specified and if you can reduce this value, you will see that displaying the signal will
                leave the full sinusoidal state.

            <Search>“SIGNAL VIEW” SETTING, PART 2 The “Operation” part is used when the user decides to conduct a
                computational operation on the existing signals. At first, the number of the required “Operations” is
                entered and clicking on “Initiate” creates
                the “Operations”. Here the number 3 was entered. A separate section is opened for each “Operation” and
                the given “Operation” can be deleted by clicking on the red Cross mark in the corner of the box. / In
                the “Operation Mode” part, it
                is found that with what kind of signal the “Operation” is performed, analog or “Dry”! If “By Dry Value”
                is selected, the active “Binary Inputs” are shown in the table At first in “Hardware Configuration” page
                binaries “C3” & “C4” are enabled
                that by using this option you can see the binaries and determine a value for them, here value “5” is
                assigned for each of them.For each operation A “Calculated” option is added above “Setting” bar per
                “Operation”. By checking this option,
                the “Calculated” signal is displayed in “Signal View”. In this diagram, the values of the contacts that
                are connected are aggregated and displayed in the diagram; this is used to test capacitive banks. For
                example, you can observe that
                the values are added in staircase by receiving the contacts “C3” and “C4”. / In the “Number of Signal”
                part, the number of signals used in “Operation” shows that 2 or 4 signals can be selected. In the
                dropdown field related to “Singnal
                1” and “Singnal 2”, the given signals are assigned to them, and by checking “Advanced” option, a section
                is opened in which the signal information, such as the signal unit, can be determined. Additionally, by
                entering a value in “Coef.”
                field, the given signal is affected by a factor, and in the “Name” field, a name can be determined for
                signal. In the “Operation”dropdown field, the user determines the type of mathematical operation to be
                performed between signals. In
                the “Advanced” part of this field, a name can be determined for this action. / After the “Operation” is
                specified, the “Add Time” part is added which can determine time intervals on the signal diagram. In
                order to make it clear, at first,
                the time state is set at 10 seconds in “detail view”, and the same intervals are determined on the
                signal by specifying a time of, for example, 2 seconds in “Auto Add Time” part. If the user intends to
                determine non-identical time intervals,
                by selecting “Add Time” a window with the same name is opened, and some rows are added by right-clicking
                upon it. The first column determines the “Operations” to be used for calculation of the values of this
                row. In “Time” column, the
                given time is selected. In “Value” column, the value of “Operation” in the given time is calculated. The
                “Slope” column is the gradient column. In “Sig1” and “Sig2” columns, the values of signals at the given
                time are determined. / / In
                the “Show Signals” part, all parameters corresponding to the voltage and current in test are determined.
                This part includes some columns and at the beginning of each, the name of the relevant parameter is
                written. Each column contains
                some options. By selecting each option, the name of its box is added at the top of the “Setting” tab,
                and then, by checking this option, the corresponding “RMS”valus is displayed in the “Signal View”. /
                When “Show Actual Value” option
                of “Binary Inputs” is set, two parts are added to “Setting” and “Signal View”, for example by checking
                “Binary-Input Target” option in the “Hardware Configuration” page and the “Binary/Analog Input” tab, all
                “Binary Inputs” are enabled.
                Then “Show Actual Value” option of one of them is set to “AC” or DC state and the “Show Actual Value”
                option of all enabled binaries is set at “AC” state upon right-clicking upon it and selecting “Set all
                Binary like this” option. You
                can observe that all “Binaries” have been added to the bar above “Setting”. By checking each of them,
                the corresponding signal can be seen in “Signal View”. In the “Select Graph For Actual Binary” part, you
                can select other signals in
                the proprietary graphs of each “Binary Inputs” whose “Show Actual Value” is enabled to be displayed. In
                addition to displaying their signals, the “Binary Inputs” are also shown in the graph. This way, a
                comparison can be made between the
                “Binary Input” signal and other signal. For example, here we determine that in addition to displaying
                trip signal, Start” and “VL1-E” signals are also shown in “C1” signal diagram. Additionally, the signal
                name can be changed. Then by
                selecting the name on the bar above “Setting”, the signals can be observed. / In “Binary Analog
                Transformer” part, the user can aggregate the signal with a constant value, multiply it by a factor, or
                apply a phase shift to it. The user
                may intend to introduce another parameter by applying these factors to the given parameter, for example,
                if the voltage signal is obtained by multiplying the current signal by 2 and aggregating it with value
                3, the introduced parameter
                will be voltage parameter by selecting the “Voltage” option. /

            <Search>”VECTOR VIEW” WINDOW, PART 1 To open this window, “Vector View” option from the “View” menu should
                be used and it is possible to open up to five “Vector Views” of simultaneously. By clicking on the right
                arrow of “Vector View” icon from the
                toolbar desired number of windows can be opened. Here, the first “Vector View” is opened. To better
                explain this window, first, we close “Detail View” and “Measurement” view windows. In summary, on this
                window it is possible to view current
                and voltage input and output values in different modes. / / / “Signal”, “Magnitude”, the first harmonic,
                phase, real value, imaginary values are displayed in “Signal”, “Magnitude”, “Harmonic 1”, “Phase”,
                “Real” and “Imaginary” columns
                respectively. Also, the arrow of signals can be made hidden in the “Show Arrow” column while the color
                of arrows can be selected from “Color” column. Moreover, to add the frequency column to this table, by
                right clicking in this area and
                selecting “Table” from “Show/Hide” option, the frequency column is added to display the frequency of
                signals. For example, “V L1-E” signal with a 63.51 volt range and a first harmonic value of 63.51, phase
                value of 0, frequency of 50,
                real value of 63.51 and imaginary value of 0 is depicted with a blue arrow. / Now, by changing the
                status of “Show Arrow” to “False”, you can see that the vector of this signal is made hidden in “Vector
                View”. To optimize the display of
                “Vector View” vectors, right click on this section and check “Optimize”. If you want to manually
                optimize the display of vectors, first you need to uncheck “Optimize” option and then optimize the
                display of vectors from the related fields
                at the corners of this page. / Also, if you want to add a signal to be displayed in “Vector View”, by
                right clicking on the vector section of this window, you should select or remove your intended mode to
                be displayed from the “Show” option.
                By default, only “Output Value” and “Actual” are selected and phase voltage and current values of the
                device are displayed. By unchecking “Output Value” and selecting “Line-Neutral”, you can see that in
                addition to phase voltage and current
                values, voltage and current values of neutral point are displayed in table and vector as well. / Also,
                if you want to display line-line values of output voltage of the device, you should select “Line-Line”
                from this list and check this
                option. Then you will see that the values of line-line voltage of the device are displayed in the above
                table and the vector display of them is displayed in the below vector. If you wish to see the
                symmetrical current and voltages, select
                “Symmetrical” option and by doing so you can see that the zero, negative and positive sequence values of
                voltage and current and their vector view are displayed in the below table. / By selecting any of the
                “Power Sv”, “Power Sa” and “Power
                Sc” options, the value of power is calculated in accordance with the current and voltage of the test as
                well as different calculation methods and then displayed in the related rows. For example, by selecting
                “Power Sv”, you can see that
                S1, S2 and S3 quantities are displayed in three rows. In “Magnitude”, “Phase”, “Real” and “Imaginary”
                columns, the apparent power value, angle, active power and reactive power are displayed respectively.
                Now, since here “Power Sv” is selected,
                the power value of “Sv” is displayed according to the formulas in the box and after being calculated
                according to vector method,it is displayed in “Sv” row. Also, in “PFv” section, the coefficient value of
                apparent power is displayed.
                / / Now, if the user selects “PowerSa”, the power value of “Sa” is calculated using the calculation
                method and according to the formulas in the box and then displayed in “Sa” field. In “PFa” field, the
                coefficient of power is first calculated
                using the same method and then displayed. / If “Power Sc” is selected, the value and coefficient of
                power are calculated using the algebraic method and the displayed formulas and then displayed in “Sc”
                and “PFc” rows. You should keep it
                in mind that S1, S2 and S3 quantities are the same in all three methods and displayed on the vector.
                Also, when the load is unbalanced, “Power Sc” method works better than the others and VƩ and IƩ
                parameters refer to algebraic sum of voltages
                and algebraic sum of currents respectively. Also, V and I parameters refer to current and voltage of the
                system which are calculated in a four-phase system using the displayed formulas. /

                must be set on “Fault Values” or other
                types of faults available in this drop-down list. By selecting “Fault Value”, “VFault” and “IFault” rows
                are added to the table. It is possible to directly determine the value of these rows in “Vector View”. /
                The next option is “Fault
                Impedance” which is activated by selecting “Set Mode: Distance” in “Detail View” window. By selecting
                “Set Mode: Distance” in “Detail View” and “Fault Impedance” option in “Vector View”, a new row named
                “ZFault” is added to “Vector View”
                table. Note that when this row is added, it is no more possible to modify “VFault” and “IFault” and
                impedance fault is directly entered in “ZFault” row. “Angle for directional” option shows the angle
                between currents and line and neutral
                voltages which is suitable for analyzing directional over current tests. For this information to be
                displayed, it is necessary to set “Set Mode” on “Overcurrent: I Test” in “Detail View” window. The next
                option is “Differential”. “HW”
                in front of this option means that this option is disabled due to “Hardware Configuration”. To solve
                this, go to “Hardware Configuration” and activate all 6 current phases. / “Overcurrent: I test Vdir”
                option is used for showing the current,
                line voltage and the angle between these two. Note that to display these values in “Vector View”, “Set
                Mode: Overcurrent: I test” needs to be selected in “Detail View”. “Voltages” and “Currents” options show
                output voltages and currents
                of the device in terms of different parameters including symmetrical voltage and current, neutral etc. /
                “Powers” option shows the apparent power obtained from different methods. If you want to only view the
                “Residual” voltage and current
                in “Vector View”, you can use “Residual” option while to view the “Actual” values, “Actual” option is to
                be used. “Text of Circle” and “Text of Vector” options are used to view the angles of the circle with 90
                degrees step by step and
                the name of each vector in the circle vector respectively.

                activated and “V L1-E”, “V L2-E” and “V
                L3-E” signals are assigned to “Cursor 1”, “Cursor 2” and “Cursor 3” respectively. / There are 5 states
                in “Type” field. In “Normal” state, values are displayed in the table while performing the test. By
                selecting “Orange”, an orange “Cursor”
                appears at the top of the widow which is linked with “Cursor 1” in “Signal View” window and by moving
                this “Cursor”, the time is displayed in “Time” field. You can see that by moving this “Cursor” the
                signal values of all parameters are
                displayed in the table of “Vector View” window and as a vector in vector graph of this window. Because
                this “Cursor” is linked with the “Cursor1” from “Signal View” window and “VL1-E” is selected for
                “Cursor1” signal, instantaneous and
                effective values of “VL1-E” signal are displayed in “RMS” and “Value” rows in “Signal View” table

                phase 1 has a 60 degrees angle
                and the other phases are symmetrical, no signal is considered as the reference and based on what

                other signals are displayed with
                a 120 degrees phase difference. Now, if “Reference Signal” is set at “VL1-E”, you can see that “VL1-E”
                signal begins with a 0 angle and the other signals are displayed in this window with a 120 degrees phase
                difference. Since there is
                a 60 degrees phase difference between current and voltage in “Table View”, currents are displayed here
                with a 60 degrees phase difference. Also, if displaying the line is activated in the window, by checking
                “Show VLL from zero” option,
                you can see that the vector view of them is displayed from zero in the vector graph of this window. / If

            <Search>“MEASUREMENT VIEW” WINDOW, PART1 In reletion the “sequencer” windows, the “Measurement View” window
                would be explained in this video. This window is used to evaluatthe test results and some criteria
                determineg for the “Pass” or “Fail” of the
                test. Note that evaluation can be performed before or after the test then the results rvaluated. To
                explain this section three “states” of “Prefault”, “Fault” and “Postfsult” are created in the
                “TableView” that the followed voltages are
                injected:” in “Prefault”, content voltage of 10 V for two seconds; in the “Fault” state, the voltage
                will increase from 10 V to 15 V as “continuous Ramp” in 10 seconds and in “Postfault” the 0 V for one
                second. / / “Time Assessment” tab
                The “Measurement View” window has some tabs that each one evaluates a special item. In the “Time
                Assessment” tab, an event time is evaluated in the test this event is received by a signal from “Trip”
                or “Pick Up” from a relay or logic
                with a combination of various conditions. In this tab, some rows is “added” and multiple time
                evaluations can be performed. In the “Name” column, a name, for example, “Trip Time” can be inserted for
                evaluation. Since it’s possible that
                a “Trip” signal can be recorded in different times, in the “Ignore before” and “Ignore after” a General
                range from the test “States” are selected so the time evaluation of these events are performed in this
                range. For example, by selecting
                the “State :Fault”, all the events before the “Fault” “state” would be ignored in the “Ignore before”
                column. In the same way, by selecting the “State” in the “Ignore after” column, all the events after the
                “Fault” “state” are ignored.
                In the “Start” column, the time reference and in the “Stop” column, the event that is meant to be
                evaluated is specified. Here, receiving the “start” signal are selected from binary 4 as the reference
                and receiving the “Trip” contact as
                the binary3 would be selected as the intended event for time evaluation. Note that, there exists an
                option named as “Logic” in the “Start” and “Stop” columns that by right-clicking on it and selecting the
                “View Custom Setting”, a logic
                with the combination of various conditions for evaluation start time reference and final conditions of
                evaluation time calculation would be specified. In the “TNom” column, the expected nominal time of
                “Start” and “Stop” enters and in
                the “TDev+” and “TDev-” columns, the positive and negative tolerances are entered that could be
                different from each other. / Here, to evaluate the test, a nominal time of three seconds, a positive
                tolerance of two seconds and a negative
                tolerance of one second are entered. After running the test and recording the results in the table, the
                real-time of the event is specified in the “TAct” column that is about 3.623 seconds and its deviation
                from the “TNom” is recorded
                as a percentage in the “TDev” column. In the “Assessment” column, the evaluation is performed that if
                the “Tact” time is in the defined range of Tnom-TDev- to Tnom+TDev+, the evaluation is “Passed” and if
                it is not in this range the evaluation
                is “Failed”. Here, because the 3.623 seconds are located in the range of 2 to 5 seconds, the test is
                passed. In the “user comment” column, you can enter your desired notes. / In the right-clicks of this
                section, by selecting the “Copy”
                option, the information of an evaluation row could be copied and by “Pasting” it, a new row with the
                information is created. By selecting the “Add” option, a blank row is added to the evaluation table. By
                selecting the “Insert before”
                and “Insert After” a blank row is added before and after the selected row and other time evaluations can
                be defined in these rows. The “Delete” will delete the selected row. / The last option in this section
                is the “Show/ Hide” option
                that is composed of two “Table” and “Report” options. There exists a list in the “Table” and “Report”
                sections that are exactly the same as the evaluation table columns. By unchecking each of them, that
                column would be deleted from the
                “Table” in the “Measurement View” or the “Report” section.

        <contant id="Level_assessment_tab">
            <Search>“LEVEL ASSESSMENT” TAB One of the tool for evaluating the binary inputs that should be preserved
                during the test is “level assessment”. In “level assessment” tab, the binary situation of the device
                inputs can be assessed at the start of a
                “state”. An example is provided for this process. / First three “states” are created in the window
                “table view”. Then, the range of voltage signals are inserted as “30” v in “state1”. The value of “4”
                seconds is inserted in the “trigger”
                field. Then, the value of “10” v is inserted in “state2” and its time is set as “3” second. The value of
                “30” v is inserted in “state3” and its time is set as “4” seconds. / In the following, by clicking
                “hardware configuration” in the
                tab “analog out”, current signals become deactivated. The binary inputs 3 and 4 can be activated in the
                tab “binary/analog input” in “binary-input target”; then, they are assigned a name. Here, the type of
                binary inputs is set as “dry”.
                / Then in the window “measurement view”, click on the tab “level assessment”. In this tab by clicking
                “state name”, the names of the existing “states” are inserted in “table view”. This name is uneditable.
                Note that in this tab, you cannot
                add a line manually. In the “level assessment” tab, the right click tool is deactivated, and for every
                “state” in the window “table view”, a line has been created in this tab. So, the number of assessments
                in this section depends on the
                number of “states” existing in the “table view” window. س / The result of assessment is presented in the
                “assessment” column. The value of time tolerance for assessment of the zero or one level of the binary
                input is entered into the column
                “tolerance”. It can be simply stated that assessment of the level of each signal at the right and left
                sides of the starting point of each state depends on the value of time tolerance specified in this part.
                Suppose that the value of 30
                ms is inserted as the tolerance of a binary input, the figure presents the schematic level assessment of
                the signal of this binary input. As it is obvious, level assessment at the two sides of state2 is done
                by a time tolerance of 30 ms
                in order to check the condition specified for this assessment; for example the level of the binary input
                should be equal to 1. As assumed, if the considered condition is that the level of Trip signal should be
                equal to 1 for state2, the
                result of assessment will be passed. / Specifying the binary levels In the “level assessment” tab, the
                number of binaries defined in “hardware configuration”, column is added with the same name. In this
                part, you can set the level one
                or zero regardless of the binary level condition that is X. In this film, the goal is the assessment of
                the level one of the binary 3 Trip in “state2”. Suppose that the level of binary 3 before and after the
                second “state” is equal to
                one for “40” ms and assessment result is pass. For this purpose, the value of “40” ms is inserted in
                “state2” in the field “tolerance”, and the level one is inserted in the field “Trip” binary 3. A comment
                about the assessment can be inserted
                in “user comment” that is also used in the output report. Then run the test. After the test, assessment
                is done and the result is presented in “assessment”. As seen in “signal view”, before and after the
                “state2”, binary one has been preserved
                for at least “40” ms. So, the result of assessment is “pass”. /

        <contant id="Ramp_Assessment_Tab">
            <Search>“RAMP ASSESSMENT” TAB The “Ramp Assessment” tab is used for evaluating a signal in case special
                condition in the test. For example, if a relay picks up, the current amplitude is assessed and
                evaluated. Note that this evaluation is used only
                for the “States” of the “Ramp” type. For better explanation, three states are generated in such a way
                that the first state is adjusted as “Normal” with the voltage of 5 V for two seconds, the second “State”
                is adjusted as “Step Ramp” from
                5 V to 20 V with 1 V steps and the third “State” is adjusted as “Step Ramp” from 30 V to 50 V with 2 V
                steps. In addition, in the first column a name, for example, Ramp will be entered for evaluation. / In
                the “Ramp State”, the intended
                “State” is selected from the “states” of the “Ramp”. Note that because this evaluation is only for the
                “Ramp” type “States”, the first “State” that is as “Normal” type is not shown in this field and from the
                states of two and three, the
                “State 2” will be selected for evaluation. In the “condition” column, a condition is specified for
                evaluation that here, the intended condition is specified as receiving the “Trip” signal from one
                binary. Also, in the “Signal” column,
                the intended parameter for evaluation is selected. For example, the “VL1-E” is selected. It means that
                the “VL1-E” voltage is evaluated when the trip signal is received. If you want to evaluate other signals
                simultaneously, you have to
                the right-click, select the “Add” option and create other columns and define another evaluation. Other
                existing options in the right-click section has been explained in previous videos. In the “Signal Type”
                column, you have to set the
                evaluation to be performed on what parameter of the selected signal. Here, the “Amplitude” is selected.
                In the “Nom” column, the intended value of the amplitude in the time of term happening is specified. For
                example, this value is set
                to be 40 V. in the “Dev+” and “Dev-“ columns, the positive and negative tolerances are entered in which
                can be different from each other. Here, to observe the performance of this section, the positive and
                negative tolerances of 2 V and
                3 are, respectively. / By running the test, in the time of receiving the “trip 0-1” signal by third
                binary of the device, the actual value of amplitude of the “VL1-E” signal is shown in the “Act” column
                in which its deviation from the
                nominal value in the “Dev” column is about 42 In the “Assessment column, the evaluation result specifies
                that if the “Act” value is located in the allowable range i.e. Nom- Dev- to Nom+ Dev+, the assessment
                result will be “Passed”, otherwise
                it would be “Failed”. Here, because the value of 42 is in the range of 37 V to 42 V, this evaluation
                will be “Passed”. In the “T Act” column, the “Trip” signal receiving time is specified and recorded by
                the device that here, this time
                is about 3.39 seconds. Also, in the “T Act Final Step” column, the receiving time of the “Trip” signal
                is recorded from the last step of the “Ramp”, which here is about 399.2mili seconds. In addition, if you

                and “VL3-E” will be selected, respectively.
                / In the “signal Type” column, you have to adjust which parameter should be evaluated. Here, this
                parameter will be selected as “Amplitude” so the amplitude of the “V L3-E” signal in the assessment time
                will be measured and evaluated.

                that these tolerances can
                be different from each other. Therefore, the positive tolerance and negative tolerance are entered as 1

                L3 E” signal amplitude is shown
                in the “Act” column. Also, its deviation from the expected value is specified in the “Dev” column in
                percentage, which here is zero percent. In addition, the assessment result will be specified in the

                Assessment. The assessment in this
                tab is defined according to the comparison of the signal with the reference signal. For assessment, if
                both the signals are identical in the specified time period and have a similar status, then the
                assessment will be "Passed". Otherwise,
                the assessment is "Failed" showing that the relay didn’t have a similar performance while importing
                error and had another status. // To do this at first, some adjustments should be performed in some
                windows. In the following, an example
                of the test will be discussed. At first, the "Transient" state will be selected in the "Detail View"
                window and by clicking on the "Import Comtrade…" file, the transient state of the "Micom P441" relay is
                loaded. Then, by clicking on the
                "Current State" option from the toolbar, all the active and inactive binaries existing in the "Comtrade"
                file and the voltage and current signals are displayed. In the following, by checking the "Calculate RMS
                …", the software calculates
                the effective values and the phases of the signals. // Subsequently, from the "Detail View" window and
                "Binary out" tab, each of the existing signals in the "Comtrade" file that should be tested and assessed
                should be ascribed to a "Binary
                Output" and selected as the reference signal. In this video, two "ZONE1" and "ANY TRIP" signals are
                ascribed to "binary out" 1 and "Binary Out" 2, respectively and the reception of trip signal from the
                relay signal is compared to "ZONE1"
                signal to be assess. / In the "Hardware Configuration" window, "Binary / Analog Input" tab, binary 1
                with the name of “Trip" is connected to the relay trip contact for comparison with the active reference
                signal. In the "Transient Assessment"
                tab, in the "Name" field a name for example "trip1" is inserted for assessment. The "State1" that is a
                transient state is selected in the "Transient State". In the "Reference Signal", the reference signal
                that is selected in the "Binary
                Output" is inserted ZONE1 and the "Trip" signal is selected in the "Signal" field for comparison. In the
                "T Dev. -" and "T Dev. +" time tolerance "3" is inserted. In order to observe the "Binary Input" status,
                the "All State" option are
                selected from the toolbar and the test is executed so the fault is applied to the relay. Finally, in the
                "Signal View" the relay has the same performance as the reference signal, which is defined as the
                "Binary Output1", and the assessment
                result is "Passed". / //

            <Search>RUNNING THE TEST After designing the test in each room, run the test. Here, the "Pick up", "Drop
                off" test is designed for the three-phase state in the "overcurrent" relay. In this test, the "CT"s
                turns ratio is set to be 1/1000 and the "Pick
                up" current of the relay is set to be 2 A. In addition, binary inputs 1 and 2 of the device are
                activated to receive the "Trip" and "Pick up" signals of the relay. To perform the "Pick up" test, a
                "State" with the name of "Pick up" and
                as increasing "Ramp" type is designed, in such a way that the three-phased current increases from 800 mA
                to 3 A each 500 ms with the 50 mA steps in the stepwise state. To end the "Pick up" test, in the
                "Trigger" tab, the binary condition
                of "C2:Start", "0-˃1" is adjusted. The intended "State" for the "Drop off" test is designed as a
                decreasing "Ramp" type from 3 A to 800 mA in such a way that it decreases 50 mA each 500 ms in the
                stepwise state. In this "State", the condition
                for the test end is adjusted to be "C2:Start", "1-˃0" so if the relay "Drops" the test would end.
                Remember that in the "Detail View" window from the state related to the "Drop off" test, you can check
                the "Continue Last State Amplitude"
                so immediately after the first state ends the current amplitude of the second state would start from the
                previous value in the first state as "Ramp" type until the relay drops. By doing this, the test duration
                decreases. // // / For this
                test, in the "Measurement View" window, several assessments are designed for analyzing the actual values
                of "pick up" and "Drop". In the first row, the actual value of the "Pick up" current related to the
                first phase is evaluated. To do
                this, in the "Ramp State", the " S1: Pick up" is selected, the intended condition for assessment is "C2:
                Start 0-˃1", the intended signal is "I L1", and the parameter type for assessing this signal is selected
                in the "Signal Type" as "Amplitude".
                Now, because the "Pick up" current is 2 A, two is inserted in the "Nom" column that the relay should
                pick up this current in ideal condition. In addition, the "Dev+" and "Dev-" columns the 100 mA
                tolerances are selected for assessment.
                The assessment of phase two and three picks up current is performed in the same way in the second and
                third-row only with this difference that in the "Signal" column related to these two assessments the "I
                L2" and "I L 3" signals are selected.
                / Also, in the fourth row, the actual "Drop" current of the phase one is assessed. For this reason, the
                "Ramp State" is adjusted on "S2: Drop off" and in the "Condition" column, the "C2: Start 1-˃0"
                condition, is selected for "I L1" signal.
                For this assessment, the intended parameter in the "Signal Type" has been selected as "Amplitude". Now,
                because the current amplitude of the relay "Drop" is 1.9 A, in the "Nom" column, the 1.9 A with 50 mA as
                positive and negative tolerances
                is adjusted. Remember that the current drop assessment in phases two and three are performed in the same
                way with this difference that in the "Signal" column, the "I L2 " and "I L3" phases are selected. To run
                the test, you have to click
                on the "Start" icon in the "Toolbar" section of the software. You can then see that at first, the first
                state that is designed for "Pick up" test is executed and after applying the trip signal and meeting the
                specified condition in the
                "Trigger" tab, the second state is executed and tested. Besides, you can use the "Test" menu or "F5" key
                on the keyboard to run the test. In order to apply the changes in the designed states and also re-run
                the test, you have to "Clear"
                the previous test results using the "Clear Test" icon in the "Toolbar". Now, by clicking on the
                red-colored cross icon you see that this test is "Cleared" and the icon related to "Start" is activated.
                Furthermore, using the "F4" on the
                keyboard the test can be "cleared". If you want some specified "States" to be executed from the designed
                "States" in the "Table View", you have to check them in the "Table View" window or by clicking on the
                right-side arrow of the "Start"
                icon, by selecting the "Start Selected State", run the selected "States". By selecting the "Start
                Unselected State" option the unselected "States" are executed. In addition, if you want to stop the test
                while its performing, you have to
                click on the "Stop Test" or press "F6". For example, by checking the second "State" by clicking on the
                right-side arrow of the "Start" icon, the "Start Selected State" is selected and you see that only the
                second "State" is executed. Now,
                by clicking on the "Stop Test" icon, this "State" end and the current injection is halted before meeting
                the specified conditions in the "Trigger" tab. / /

                select the "Immediately" radio button. After selecting this option in Status bar, the St. Cond. is set
                on the "Immediately" and after
                running it the test stars immediately there is no delays exist between clicking on "Start" and "Run".
                Please remember that the software default is this option. / / If you want the test to be run after
                receiving the contact by one of the
                binaries, you have to select the "On Binary Input" option. By selecting this option, its right side
                option is selected that you have to select the intended binary in it to start the test. In this field,
                the activated binaries are shown
                in the "Hardware Configuration". For example, the "C2: Start" is selected, now in the statusbar, the
                "St. Cond." has been set on the BI.2-Start. After clicking on the "Start" icon, you see that because not
                receiving the contact by the
                "C2" binary, the test has not been executed, now by receiving the contact by this binary, the test runs.
                The third method to start and run a test is the use of a "GPS" antenna. By selecting the "On GPS", a
                test could run according to the
                "GPS" clock. One of the applications of this option is in the longitudinal differential or "End to End"
                tests. To run the test using this option, the socket of the "GPS" antenna should be connected to the
                rear part of the "AMT105" device
                and the antenna is located in open space. By clicking on the "Start Sync" option, the "sync" process of
                the device with the satellite begin and in the "GPS Status:" field shown in the figure the "GPS" status
                is shown. By "Syncing" of the
                device and software in the "GPS Status:" field, the "GPS is Sync" term is shown. In addition, in status
                bar, the St. Cond. is set on the GPS Sync. Also, in the status bar, GPS time error is displayed in the
                "Time Error" section. Please
                remember that this number should be less than 1000 ns. The tester time is displayed online in this
                toolbar. In the "Satellite Signal Level History" section, the number of satellites and the strength of
                each signal is shown. If the number
                of satellites and the signal strength is proper, the phrase "Detected" is displayed in the "Time Pulse"
                field and the device receives the "GPS" signals. Then, the device should be able to synchronize its time
                with the received signals
                from the "GPS". The date and time of the tester are specified in the "Date and Time Tester" section that
                this time should be identical with the time of the "GPS" in the "Data and Time GPS" field. / / / In the
                32 bits windows, if the tester
                time is not the same as the time of your personal computer, you can use the Set Windows" "Time GPS Win
                X86 so the time of your computer become identical with the "GPS" time. Using the "Next Full" and "Start
                Time" options, how and when
                the test run are selected. Using the "Next Full", after selecting this option, you have to specify the
                time between the sequential tests for the "Shot test" from the drop down list. For example, if you have
                several test points in the differential
                test, by selecting the "10 Second", the GPS, by considering the injection time of the device, starts to
                count down in 10 s cycles and in case of existence of untested point, when the inverse counter reaches
                zero, the next point is tested.
                Using this option, the start time for the "End to End" tests might not be the same. To solve this
                problem, you have to start the test using the "Start Time". Remember this time is the time that the
                device adjusts with the "GPS". Remember
                in this method, only the first point is tested and the rest won’t. For these kinds of tests, the "Next
                Full" and "Start Time" should be simultaneously checked so the first point start with the "GPS" clock
                and the next points would run
                with the "Next Full" method. For example, if in the differential room and for "End to End" test you have
                got four test points and want to run the test at the same time with another point, you have to set the
                "Start Time" on a special time,
                for example, 17:47:30 and also, set the "Next Full" on 10 seconds. The first point is tested in the
                specified time and the next points are tested during the specified time period in the "Next Full". You
                also see that in the status bar,
                the test time of each point and the remaining time until the next intended test point will be displayed
                in the "Start" and "Left Time" sections, respectively. In the "Data" section, the data about the "GPS"
                time, test location, etc. are
                shown. In the "Data and Time GPS" field, the time and data received from "GPS" are displayed. In
                addition, after that the "Sync" ends, the tester time is recorded in the "Date and Time Tester" field.
                Remember this time should be identical
                with the time recorded in the "Date and Time GPS". Also, the geographical width and length of the test
                location are displayed in "Latitude" and "Longitude" fields, respectively and added to the test report
                to be used, the exact location
                of the test could be found on the map. In addition, in this section, in the "Altitude" section, the
                "GPS" amplitude with respect to the base level are displayed. In the "Fix Mode", "PDOP" and "HDOP"
                fields, various models of the location,
                location precision and altitude precision are displayed. In the satellite field, the number of
                satellites used for settings are displayed. If the device receives the sent pulses from the “GPS”, in
                the "Time Pulse" field the word "Detected"
                is displayed. But if these signals are not received, the word "Not Detected" is displayed. In addition,
                in the "Satellite Signal Level" window, the signals receiving level from the "GPS" are displayed and in
                the "Satellite Signal Level
                History", the number of satellites and the signal strength related to various satellites are displayed.

                for the desired number of times. The number of test repetitions are inserted in the "Number of
                Repetition" field that the test can run for a maximum of 1000 times. For example, here, the number five
                is inserted so the test would be repeated
                five times. Also, if the user wants to make a delay between each test repetition, he can enter this time
                as a delay in the "Time between Repetitions". For example, here, the 1 second is inserted and the test
                "RUN". You see that the intended
                test runs five times and with the time intervals of 1 second. /

                relay information and settings
                in the software. To do this, first, select “Test Object” from the toolbar and from the tree diagram in
                “Device” section enter “I primary” and “I secondary” information which are the “CT” turn ratio. Note
                that any mismatch between the setting
                of this section and the relay will lead to wrong responses in relay test. / Next, you need to enter the
                relay setting from the tree diagram in “Over Current” block. By double-clicking on this block,
                “Overcurrent Protection Parameters”
                page opens which includes “Relay Parameters” and “Elements” tabs. In “Relay Parameters tab, in “Relay
                Behavior” section, first you need to determine whether the relay is “Directional” or “Non-Directional”.
                Then, in “Tolerance” section
                and “Current”, “Time” and “Angle” sections, current and time tolerances and for “Directional” tests,
                angular tolerance are entered. / / In “Elements” section, you need to determine the relay characteristic
                curve and its characteristics.
                To do so, first the type of intended current protection should be selected in “Selected Elements Type”.
                Then, you need to specify the characteristic curve information in the table in this page and create the
                relay “Curve”. / / / By using
                “Add”, you can add more rows to the table and if there are multiple “Stages”, create another “Curve”.

                curve is specified for “Dropping” the relay, you can enter its setting in “Reset Characteristic”
                section. The “Curve” of every “Stage”
                is displayed separately in the diagram at the right side. In “View Resulting Characteristic” section,
                you can view the characteristic curve resulted from specified “Stages”. / / If in “Relay Behavior” page,
                the relay is specified as a
                “Directional” one, another tab named “Define Element Directional Behavior” is added where the setting
                related to the unit protected by the relay is entered. Moreover, a polar diagram is added in which the
                angle protected by the relay is
                specified schematically. / After entering the relay characteristic and confirming the changes, it is
                possible to specify some points on the characteristic curve and run the test in “Test View” and “Over
                Current Characteristic”. In future
                videos, each of the mentioned sections will be explained in greater detail. By selecting any of the
                “Element Versions” in the “Compatibility” section, the pickup current coefficients change for each
                element. By selecting “Advanced Element”,
                the coefficients for the specified characteristics is change into what can be seen in the picture. This
                means that the pickup current determined for that characteristic is multiplied by the displayed
                coefficient and “Fault Type” is applied
                for it. As an example, if you determine an element in negative sequence and you wish to test this
                element in “L1L2” mode, this characteristic can be tested by multiplying square root of 3 in pickup
                current. These coefficients are extracted
                from negative, positive and zero sequence matrix. One example is provided about how to calculate these
                coefficients and other coefficients can be achieved by following the same procedure. / But in “Simple
                Fault Loop” which is an algorithm
                used by older relays, these coefficients are, as you can see, different. To facilitate analyzing the
                effects of coefficients on characteristics, there is a section named “More Details” on “Test View” page
                by double-clicking on which another
                section opens where the information regarding the characteristics along with their coefficients are
                displayed. The difference between “Advanced Element” and “Zero-Sensitive Elements” is in the “3I0”
                characteristic coefficient; one of these
                two should be selected in accordance with the relay algorithm.

            <Search>RELAY SETTING IN OVERCURRENT ROOM, PART1 As mentioned before, to test a relay, the first step is to
                enter the relay characteristic in the software. To do this, first how to enter the setting for a
                “Non-directional” relay is going to be explained.
                Enter “General Test Object” window and after changing the “CT” turns ratio to 500/1 in “Device” block,
                by double-clicking on “Overcurrent” block, “Overcurrent protection parameters” page opens where you can
                enter the relay setting. In
                “Relay behavior” section, the setting related to relay protection, placement of “VT”s as well as wiring
                of “CT”s are specified. Since here our relay is “Non-directional”, “Non-directional” should be selected
                in this window. Note that the
                setting related to “VT Connection” and “CT Connection” are only active in “Directional” mode and in
                “Non-directional” relays, these options are disabled. / / / In “Directional” relays, current, time and
                angular tolerances are set in “Tolerances”
                section. To set current tolerance, you need to enter your intended tolerance as a percentage of the test
                current in “Relative” field. You can see that this tolerance is set at 5 percent by default. Also, in
                “Absolute” section, it is possible
                to enter this tolerance as a coefficient of “CT” nominal current in this field and view its actual value
                in the front field. Moreover, it is possible to enter the numerical value of tolerance and view its
                related coefficient in the previous
                field. For example, in this field 40 mA is entered as the tolerance. You can see that the coefficient
                related to this current, changes in the corresponding field. Note that the software picks the maximum
                tolerance between the two tolerances
                specified for the characteristic curve. For example, if the test current is set at 1 amp, with a 5
                percent tolerance, the current is calculated between 1.05 and 0.95 amp but if a 40 milliamp tolerance is
                used, the pickup current is calculated
                between 1.04 and 0.96 amp. The software picks the highest values which is between 1.05 and 0.95 amp. In
                “Time” section, the time tolerances are specified in percentage and actual forms and the angular
                tolerance is specified in “Angle”
                section. / To specify the characteristic curve, you need to enter “Elements” tab. In “Element Name”
                column, a title for the specified “Stages” is entered. For example, here “Stage1” is selected. In
                “Tripping Characteristic” column it is
                possible to specify the type of the characteristic curve which is set at “IEC Definite Time” by default.
                To change the intended characteristic curve, double-click on “IEC Definite Time” or click on three dots
                sign from “Characteristic”
                section to open “Manage / Select Characteristic” window. In “Standard” section, you can view the
                available characteristic curves in “IEC” standard and by selecting any of these you can view its formula
                and coefficients in “Characteristic”
                section. Note that it is necessary to select the same characteristic curve as the one specified for the
                relay. / / If you cannot find the characteristic curve specified for the relay here or the coefficients
                of the formulae are different,
                by entering “Predefined” folder, you can find the relay characteristic curve from “Inverse”, “I2T”, IAC”
                and “Reclosers” folders and then select it. Also, if you cannot find the relay formula in any of the
                folders, in “Custom” folder,
                by selecting “Custom Formula” it is possible to specify your intended formula according to the
                coefficients specified in this section as well as the value of “Itest/Ipickup” and “Time dial” which are
                indicated by “M” and “Td” respectively.
                After doing so, you can save and use the formula. Moreover, if the relay characteristic curve is based
                on the points table, you can add the characteristic curve point by point and view its curve by selecting
                “Table Example 2” and using
                the “Grabber” tool available in the software. This window will be fully explained in future videos. / /
                / If the characteristic curve formula is available in the software, but the used coefficients are not
                the same as the ones in the relay’s
                manual, you need to select the intended formula and by “Copying” and “Pasting” it in “User defined”
                section, change its coefficients and use the formula according to the coefficients specified in the
                relay’s manual. To facilitate doing
                this, “Copy to user defined” option has been made available and you can use it. For example, here the
                formula related to “Basler I2T-46N” curve is copied and pasted in “User defined” section. Now, by
                selecting it, you should enter your
                intended coefficients and by saving the new curve with the selected coefficients, it is saved in the
                software and can be used. To continue the process, the “IEC Normal Inverse” curve is selected here. You
                can see that in “Elements” tab,
                an “Inverse Normal” “Stage” is entered. Now in “I Pick-up” column, you should set the pickup current of
                the relay according to a coefficient of “CT” secondary nominal current which, here, is set at 1.1. Also,
                it is possible to set the
                pickup current from “I Pick-up” field at the bottom of this tab. After setting the pickup current, its
                value is displayed in “Absolute” column. In “Time” column, “TMS” or “Time dial” of the relay is entered.
                This value can also be entered
                in “Time Index” field at the bottom of this tab and 0.5 is entered here. In “Reset Ratio” column, “Drop
                Out” coefficient of the relay is entered which is set at 0.95 by default. Also, you can see that in
                “Direction” column, the type of
                this curve is set at “Non-Directional”. Um den Vorgang fortzusetzen, wird hier die Kurve „IEC Normal
                Inverse“ ausgewählt. Sie können sehen, dass auf der Registerkarte „Elemente“ eine „Inverse Normale“
                "BühneStufe" eingegeben wird. Sie

            <Search>RELAY SETTING IN “OVERCURRENT” ROOM, PART 2 After specifying a “Stage” for the relay characteristic
                curve, it is possible to specify the characteristic curve time and current range limits in “Range
                limits” section. To do this, you need to
                activate this section by checking “Active” option and enter the required ranges in according fields. For
                example, here, “I min” equals 1.2 times “lref” and “l max”, 100 times “Iref” is entered. At the right
                side of this window you can
                see that the characteristic curve of the relay is specified to be between 1.2 and 100 times of the
                reference current which is the same as “Iref” or “CT” secondary. Also, the minimum time is entered in “t
                min” field and here “1.5” second
                is entered. In “t max” field, on the other hand, the maximum time is entered which, here, is 40. Now you
                can see the effect of these changes on the characteristic curve.Moreover, for relays that act in
                “Definite Time” mode from currents
                higher than a specific amount, “Limit t from I” option can be used. For example, for relays that act
                from 1.1 time of the determined “Pickup” current and act in “Definite Time” mode from 20 times of the
                “Pickup” current, the settings are
                entered as can be seen. / / In “Reset Characteristic” section, you can specify the setting related to
                “Drop out” characteristic curve of the relay which is set at “Off” by default. This means that as soon
                as the fault current falls below
                the relay “Drop” current, the pickup contact must be removed from the relay. By selecting “Definite
                time”, “tr” field is activated and you can specify a time for “Drop out” of the relay. For example, if
                1.5 second is entered here, when
                the fault current falls below the specified value, the pickup contact must be removed from the relay
                after 1.5 second. Also, by selecting “Inverse time”, “R” and “T” fields are opened and it is made
                possible to specify an “Inverse” curve
                for “Drop out” time of the relay according to the formula displayed in “Formula” section and by
                specifying “R” and “T” values. Note that it is possible to manage “Reset Characteristic” and “Range
                limits” sections from “manage / select
                characteristic” page as well. / If the characteristic curve of the relay comprises of multiple “Stages”,
                it is necessary to use “Add” button to specify the required number of “Stages” and by specifying their
                parameters, test the intended
                relay. For example, here, another “Stage” of “Time Definite” type is created and the pickup current is
                set at 1.5 times “I ref” and its operation time is set at 200 milliseconds in “Time” column. You can see
                that by clicking on any “Stage”,
                its corresponding characteristic curve is displayed in the right side window. Now, in “View Resulting
                Characteristic” tab, it is possible to view the final characteristic curve created. You can see that
                this curve is the result of both
                “Stages” specified in the table on this window. In “Color” column, a color is selected for each “Stage”.
                In “Active” column, it is possible to activate or deactivate any intended “Stage” by using “Yes” and
                “No” options. For example, here,
                the second “Stage” is deactivated and removed from the characteristic curve. / By using “Save as
                User-defined” option from “Manage / select characteristic” window, it is possible to add the
                characteristic curve created in each “Stage”
                in “User defined” folder and use when necessary. For example, here, the first “Stage” is selected and by
                clicking on “Save as User-defined”, the “Manage / Select Characteristic” window opens. Then, by clicking
                on “Ok” button and returning
                to this window, you can see that this curve and its setting are added to this folder with the name of
                IEC Normal Inverse2. /

            <Search>RELAY SETTINGS IN “OVERCURRENT” ROOM, PART 3 As mentioned before if the relay characteristic curve
                is provided as a table of points, the user needs to manually enter these points into the software. To do
                so, first, “Table Example 2” is selected
                from “Custom” folder in “Manage/Select Characteristic” window. You can see that, by default, a curve is
                created in this section using the points table. / To specify a new curve, by clicking on “Copy to User
                Define” option, this curve is
                copied to “User Define” folder and after selecting this curve in “User Define” folder, by clicking on
                “Grab” the window related to the “Grabber” opens. In this diagram the "X" axis is the current axis, and
                the "Y" axis is the time axis.
                In “Axes” section, to show the curve, the current range is specified in terms of “IPu” and the time
                range is specified in terms of seconds. For example, here the current range is specified between 1 “IPu”
                and 100 “IPu” and the current
                axis is displayed between 1 and 100 “IPu”. “IPu” is the CT secondary nominal current. Also, by
                unchecking the “Logarithmic” option, it is possible to change the diagram display from logarithmic to
                regular. Also, by using “Open” and “Save”
                options it is possible to save the created file in this section and open it again on this page and edit
                or use it if necessary. / Now, from the toolbar click on “New” to open a new blank page for the new
                curve. In “Point” section, enter
                the current in “Current” field and time in “Time” field and then “Add” them to the points table of the
                intended characteristic curve so that it is displayed in the diagram at the right side. Also, by
                clicking on the related diagram and
                selecting “Add” or by using the “Ctrl” key and clicking on the diagram, it is possible to create the
                characteristic curve. By using “Add” and “Insert” buttons, it is possible to add the point entered in
                “Point” section to the last row
                of the table and before the selected row respectively. / / / If the user has a logarithmic image of the
                relay characteristic curve, it is possible to “Load” it in this window by using “Load Image” option and
                create the relay characteristic
                curve for the test by adding the point on the entered curve. Now, here we enter an image of the “7UT63”
                relay overcurrent characteristic. Then it is necessary to equalize the “Scales” of the diagram in this
                page with the “Scales” of the
                entered diagram. To do so, first, by using Alt+left click combination key the current and time axes of
                the entered image are equalized with the current and time axes of the “Grabber” window. Then, the
                “Start” and “End” values are specified
                in “Current” section as 1.05Pu1 and 1.45 respectively. Also, the “Start” and “End” values are specified
                in “Time” section as 0.05 and 200 seconds. You can see that both diagrams are completely overlapping.
                Note that these numbers are different
                for images with different sizes and they need to be specified by the user in a way that the two diagrams
                overlap in terms of values and size. / / Now, by holding down the “Ctrl” key and clicking on the curve
                with “Dial Setting=0.1”, this
                characteristic curve is created and approved. If you wish to save this curve in the software for future
                tests, you need to copy it using the “Copy” button and “Paste” it in “User Defined” folder. Now, by
                selecting “Save”, the intended
                characteristic curve is saved in this folder and is usable for next tests. / Note that if a later
                version of the software is installed, this saved file is removed from the “User Defined” folder. So
                before installing the new version of
                the software, it is necessary to make an output “Xml” file by using the “Export” button from “Manage
                Select Characteristic” page and then “Import” it to the new version. This characteristic curve is
                displayed in the diagram at the right
                side of the “Overcurrent Protection Parameters” window. Note that for the characteristic curves created
                using this method, the time entered in “Time” column of the characteristic table of the characteristic
                curve is a coefficient which
                is multiplied by the times entered in the characteristic points table and as a result it influences the
                characteristic curve time and relay operation time. /

                Then, specify the directions of “VT” and “CT Start Point” in “VT Connection” and “CT Start Point
                Connection” respectively. Note that mismatch between this section and the relay setting will result in a
                180 degree phase difference between
                the device and relay settings. / After entering the intended “Stages” in “Element” section, whether the

                This window comprises of 5 tabs of “Shot Test”, “Pick Up-Drop Off”, “Setting”, “Trigger” and “Binary
                Output”. Specifying the test points is
                done in “Shot Test” and “Pick Up-Drop Off” tabs. / In “Shot Test” tab, you can select fault type and the
                points for the test and after the test is performed, you can view the results of the evaluation. In this
                tab, in “Test Point” section
                the fault current and in “Fault Type” section the fault type are determined. In “Test Point” section,
                the fault current and the angle between current and voltage are specified in “I Test” and “Angle” fields
                respectively. Note that this
                angle is only useful for performing “Directional” tests. !/ If you want to specify the fault current in
                terms of a coefficient of “CT” nominal current or “Pick Up” current of one of the specified “Stages”,
                you need to check “I Test Relative”
                option and specify the coefficient in “Factor” field and then, from “Relative to” drop list select the
                base current to specify the fault current. This base current can be a “Pick Up” current of one of the
                “Stages” or “CT” secondary nominal
                current. After specifying the test current, you need to select the fault type from the standard faults
                available in “Fault Type” section. These faults include different types of phase to earth, two phase,
                three phase, inconsistency, “3I0”
                and “L1”, “L2” and “L3” faults. / To better understand “L1”, “L2” and “L3” faults, suppose that in a
                line, there is a transformer with a delta connection on the first side. When a fault occurs in the
                secondary side, the fault phase corresponding
                current will flow in the first side and this fault current is provided by other phase or phases.
                “Negative Sequence” or inconsistency faults test is available by selecting “I2”. Since relays detect
                inconsistency fault by using the value
                of negative sequence current, by selecting this type of “Fault Type”, the entered fault current will
                merely be negative sequence current. “3I0” fault is useful for “Earth Fault” in “Summation” mode while
                “L-E” fault is useful in “Measuring”
                mode. / / By clicking on “Add”, the selected test point is added to the table in this window. Regarding
                the test points, note that if you check the "I Test Relative to" option and make the test stream
                dependent to a parameter and "Add"
                that point, that test point is always dependent on the value of that parameter and by changing the value
                of that parameter, the amount of the test current also changes. To clear the subject, check the "I Test
                Relative to" option and the
                test current is defined twice the rated current, and this point is added to the test table. Now if you
                change the rated current to 5 amps you will see that the test current changes from 2 amps to 10 amps. By
                selecting one of the rows and
                clicking on “Insert” option, the selected row is repeated in the table and by clicking on “Remove”
                option, the selected point is removed. Also, by selecting “Add to” option, it is possible to copy point
                or points selected for one of the
                “Fault Types” to another “Fault Type”. By clicking on “Remove All” option, all test points entered in
                the table will be removed. / By clicking on “Sequence” option, “Sequence Test Points to” page opens
                where it is possible to specify test
                points with equal steps. In “Current Data” section, steps are created in direction of the range. By
                selecting “Current” in “Sequence Type” field, current steps are directly entered in terms of ampere and
                by selecting “Factor”, the current
                is entered in terms of the parameter selected in “Relate to” field. / In “Start Value”, “End Value” and
                “Step Size” fields start point of the current point, end point of the current point and steps are
                specified respectively. For example,
                “Factor”, “Pick Up” current of the first “Stage”, 2 times, 6 times and half of “Pick Up” current are
                selected as values for “Sequence Type”, “Relate to”, “Start Value”, “End Value” and “Step Size”
                respectively. You can see that “Step Count”
                which is the number of current steps or test points equals 9. / Moreover, in “Angle data” section, the
                information related to start angle, end angle and step size are entered in “Angle data”, “Start Value”,
                “End Value” and “Step Size”
                respectively. Here 30, 45 and 5 are entered as these values. In “Step Count” field, the number of
                current steps are specified which is 4 points. In “Total Shot Count” field, the sum total of points is
                calculated. This value shows that
                each point in all 4 specified angle “Steps” enters test table with a specified current range. After
                selecting the “Fault Type” of “L1-E” and “L2-E” and confirming them, you can see that these points are
                added to the test point table. /
                / If the performed test has “Failed” points, by selecting “Clear All Failed Tests” option, it is
                possible to clear all these points from the table of this section. In “Detail” section, the information
                related to “Trip” nominal time, the

                “Non-directional” relays and depending
                on the test type, the user can set it at their desired value. Now, since in “Pick Up-Drop Off” tests the
                software uses increasing or decreasing ramps, the time interval between increasing and decreasing ramps
                must be entered in “Pickup
                ∆t” and “Drop Off ∆t” respectively. By default, these values are set at 100 millisecond. In “∆I” field,
                the values of each “Step” in each time ramp is specified. Here, this value is set at 20 milliamps. Then,
                in “Pickup Start” field, the
                ramp initial current value in test is specified. Here, this value is set at 800 milliamps. This means
                that the ramp begins at 800 milliamps and increases. Moreover, it is necessary to specify the final
                values of the ramp current as well.
                These values are entered in “Pickup End” and “Drop Off End” fields for “Pickup” and “Drop Off”
                respectively. For example, here, the final current values for “Pickup” and “Drop Off” are set at 1.2 amp
                and 800 milliamps respectively. / Now,
                according to the values set in “Test Point” section, the software applies an increasing ramp from 800
                milliamps to 1.2 amp of current with 20 milliamps ramps and 100 milliseconds time interval and then
                receives the “Pickup” signal. Then,
                it applies a decreasing ramp with 20 milliamps ramp and 100 milliseconds time interval until the relay
                “Drops”. In “Fault Type” section, as mentioned before, it is possible to determine the fault type. Now,
                by using “Add” button, this
                test line is added to the characteristic curve of the relay on “Overcurrent Characteristic” window.
                Also, the related row is added to the table at the bottom of the “Pick Up-Drop Off” page. In “Detail”
                section, after the test is finished,
                the real “Pickup” current value of the relay and the relay “Drop Off” current value of the relay are
                displayed in “Pickup act” and “Drop Off act” fields respectively. / / For each “Fault Type”, this test
                is performed only in one point.
                Immediately after receiving “Pickup” contact, the ramp starts decreasing from “Pickup-End” point. If you
                wish the ramp to start decreasing from the same point as the relay “Pickup” point, you need to check
                “Last state Amplitude” option.
                / For “Directional” tests, here the settings for a “Directional” relay is in a way that the “Direction”
                is “Forward” and “Maximum torque angle” and “Sector opening” are set at -60 and 180 degrees
                respectively. Then, open “Medium Detail
                View”. In this window, the operation range of the relay is displayed in green and purple. You can see
                that this range is set between -90+60 30 degrees and -60-90 -150 degrees. In “PickUp-DropOff Data”
                section, the test lines selected from
                the created test lines are displayed in the table at the left side. In the left sidebar of this window,
                there are some tools used for diagrams which have been explained previously. / / Now, “Angle” is
                selected from “Target type” and “States”
                of the “Ramp” created by the software are put on the angle. In this mode, the value of the current and
                the fault current angle are entered in “Current” and “Angle” fields respectively. Also, the amount of
                angular changes in each ramp,
                the amount of start angle value for ramp “State” and the final value of this angle are entered in "∆∅",
                “Pickup Start” and “Pickup End” fields respectively. In “Drop Off End” field, the final angle value for
                decreasing ramp “State” is
                specified. / For example, here you should make two search lines in border points. The first search line
                is set with a 1 amp “Pickup” current and a 30 degree angle. You can see that the fields related to this
                test line are adjusted at the
                right side by the software. Note that these values can be specified by the user. Also, in graphic
                diagram of “Medium Detail View” window, the angular range of the intended test is turned pink. Now, we
                add this test line to “Pick Up-Drop
                off” test table. Now, to create the next test line, -150 is entered as the angle value in “Angle” field
                and this lined is also added to the test lines. You can see that by selecting any of the created test
                lines, its information is displayed
                in “PickUp-DropOff Data” window. Note that in performing this test, in “Pickup” current, you should
                perform the test once at the highest limit of the angle and once at the lowest limit of the angle. /

            <Search>“SETTINGS” TAB OF “OVERCURRENT” MODULE, PART 1 To continue with explaining “Overcurrent” room, in
                this video we are going to explain “Setting” tab. In this tab, you can adjust some of the test settings.
                In “Fault Inception” section, the angle
                in which the fault occurs is specified. But this angle is not the angle between current and voltage but
                it equally shifts the current and voltage values. To better understand this, select “Signal View” from
                the toolbar and check “Voltage
                Group A” in “Setting”. Then, by changing the “Angle” value, you can see the current and voltage signals.
                Note that to determine the angle between current and voltage, you need to use the “Angle” field in “Shot
                test” tab. / “Voltage Output”
                is used in “Directional” tests but if, for any reason, you wish to activate your voltages in a
                “Non-Directional” test and see the influence of changing voltages on “Overcurrent” test, you can use
                this section. In “Trigger On” field in
                “Pick up Drop off Contact” section you can determine the “Contact” to be used for doing “Pick up Drop
                Off” test. This option is used in cases where the relay does not have “Pick up” contact. In these
                relays, by reducing the trip time to
                zero, it is possible to find the approximate pickup current. / But if you do not wish to change the
                relay settings, if the relay has “LED” or “Flag” pickup, you can manually issue a “Pick Up” or “Drop
                Off” command by checking “Space Key
                Press”. You can perform the test by pressing the “Space” button once at the time of “Pick up” and once
                at the time of “Drop Off”. If you wish to create a transient state for the current waveform in “Add
                Signal” and test the transient state
                “Overcurrent”, you can do so by checking “Dc decay” decaying Dc and specifying the “Amplitude” value in
                terms of percent and time coefficient in “1/T” and then you can view the changes resulted in the
                waveform in “Signal View”. Now, if
                you wish to add “Harmonic” to the transient state, you can do so by checking “Harmonic” and specifying
                the order of the “Harmonic” in “Number” field and specifying the “Amplitude” in terms of percent and
                phase angle. Note that by unchecking
                the options in this section, the signal returns to “Normal” state. / /

            <Search>“SETTINGS” TAB OF “OVERCURRENT” MODULE, PART 2 In “Time” section, first, the injection time before
                fault in “PreFault Time” is entered. In tests such as “Directional” where by injecting voltage, “PTs”
                draw inrush current, by checking “Ramp
                in Prefault” you can create a “Ramp” voltage and prevent device errors. Note that checking this option
                is only possible for “Directional” tests or in conditions determined in “Voltage Output” section. / In
                “Max Fault Time”, the maximum
                fault injection time is specified in the form of “Abs” or “Rel” which itself includes three sections.
                Note that if the time specified in “Max Fault Time” is shorter than time of the “Trip” time of the shot
                point, result of the evaluation
                will be wrong. / If you are using “Max Fault Time Abs” field, you need to enter a time in terms of
                seconds for the maximum fault signal injection time for all points. But, to increase the speed of the
                test, you can use “Max Fault Time
                Rel”. By checking this option, three other options appear. By entering a number in “Add%ofTnom”, the
                fault signal injection time in each point equals the test point nominal time plus a percentage of the
                nominal time entered in this field.
                This means that if the test point nominal time is 10 seconds and 5 percent is entered in this field, the
                maximum fault injection time 1.05 equals the test nominal time which is 10.5 seconds. But in “Add
                Absolute” field, the fault injection
                time is entered as a sum of the test point trip nominal time plus the time entered in this field. For
                points which are in “No Trip” area, it is possible to enter a separate time in “No-Trip Time” field. If
                you enter the time in these four
                fields, the software will consider the longest time. / “Post Fault” time is entered in “Post Fault
                Time”. “Delay After Trigger” is used for specifying the trigger time of the intended key and by
                right-clicking on the related field and
                selecting “Go To Linked Value”, you can see that it is linked to “CB Trip Time” and if necessary, by
                selecting “Remove Link” you can enter your desired value instead. / By selecting “Fault Inception” in
                “Time Reference”, the “Trip” time
                from the fault injection time is calculated. But, by selecting “Starting”, the “Trip” time is calculated
                from when the “Pick-up” contact is received from the relay. / In “Load Current Prefault Current”
                section, it is possible to adjust
                the settings related to “Prefault” phase and current. By selecting “Based on Current” radio button in
                “Amplitude” section, the “Prefault” current is entered in ampere which is the same for all other test
                points. But, by selecting “Based
                on IFault”, the “Prefault” current is entered in fault current which is different for every “Shot”
                point. You can use “Phase” section for the angle between current and voltage in “Prefault”. By selecting
                the “Based on Degree” radio button,
                it is possible to specify the voltage current angle in degrees which is the same for all other test
                points. But, by selecting “Same as Fault Angle”, the angle between current and voltage in “Prefault”
                will be the same with “Fault” which
                is different for every “Shot” point. / In “Other Setting” section, by checking first run
                "PickUp-DropOff", if you have multiple "PickUp-DropOff" and “Shot Test” points, first, the
                "PickUp-DropOff" test is performed otherwise “Shot Test”
                is performed first. By checking “Continue Last State Amplitude”, in "PickUp-DropOff" test, instead of
                starting from “Pickup End” the decreasing ramp will start from where the relay performed the pick-up”. /

                method, before testing any point, a message appears and by pressing “Ok”, the software tests that point.
                / By selecting “Fault Inception” In “Time Reference”, the “Trip” time is calculated since the fault
                injection time. This option is
                used for testing the relays which do not have the “Pick Up” contact. But by selecting “Starting”, the
                “Trip” time is calculated since when the “Pick Up” contact is received from the relay. This option helps
                to increase the measurement
                accuracy of the operation time in relays with “Pick Up” contact. / In fact, when you select “Fault
                Inception”, it is like that you are putting the “trigger” on “Trip” signal. But if you select
                “Starting”, first you need to make sure that
                the relay gives a “Pick Up” signal. Selecting this option is like putting the “Trigger” on “Trip”, “Pick
                Up” and “Trigger Logic” in “And” mode. / In “Binary Output” tab, if it is necessary for the relay to see
                the key condition, by using
                the “A” or “B” group voltages or “Aux DC” it is possible to take any needed voltage to the “Binary
                Input” of the relay through “Binary Output” of the device. This tab has three “PreFault”, Fault” and

        <contant id="Introducing_VI_Starting_room">
            <Search>INTRODUCING “VI STARTING” ROOM “VI Starting” room is designed to test “51V” function. In this
                function, the pickup of overcurrent unit depends on the voltage drop. In fact, “VI Starting” is a
                current function whose “Pickup” is linked to voltage.
                Note that in “51V” function test, evaluation of detecting or not detecting fault is performed based on
                the test voltage and current amount which can be “Voltage-Controlled” or “Voltage-Restrained” and is
                used as generator-differential
                protection backup as well as for coordinating high-current relays in power systems. To explain the
                difference between these two functions, characteristic curve and examples are used. If the “51V”
                function is “Voltage-Controlled”, its characteristic
                curve will look like what you can see in this picture. For a relay with this characteristic curve, the
                relay performs the pickup in currents higher than “5A” and for currents lower than “4A” the relay does
                not perform the pickup. But if
                the current is between “4A” and “5A”, the relay performs the pickup only if the voltage is lower than
                “50V”. In the settings of this function, “4A” and “5A” currents are specified as “I” and “I”
                respectively. / In the second mode, if the
                characteristic curve is “Voltage-Restrained”, like the previous mode, the relay detects a fault if the
                current is higher than “5A” and in currents lower than “4A” it does not perform the pickup. The
                difference is that between “4A” and
                “5A”, the pickup voltage value has a linear increase. / In this function, it is possible to specify the
                settings for phase to phase and phase to earth voltage faults separately. This is also considered in the
                characteristic curve page
                of this function so that if you add a shot on the characteristic curve in single-phase “Fault Type”, the
                specified voltage is the voltage of the phase and if you select two-phase or three-phase “Fault Type”,
                the specified voltage is line-to-line
                voltage in which case the device produces the corresponding voltage to produce the line-to-line voltage.
                / / / “Test View” and “VI Starting Characteristic” are the two main windows of this room. In “Test View”
                window, the three main tests
                of this function are performed in “Shot Test”, “Check Test” and “Search Test” tabs which will be
                explained in future videos. In “VI Starting Characteristic” window, the characteristic curve of the
                function is displayed according to the
                current and voltage. To specify the settings of this function, select “Test Object” from the toolbar and
                double-click on “VI Starting” from the tree diagram and then enter your desired settings to be displayed
                in “VI Starting Characteristic”
                characteristic curve in “VI Starting Parameters” page. / Relay settings in “VI Starting” Room In VI
                Starting Parameters page, you can enter the characteristic curve information in characteristic section.
                In I and I fields, the lower and
                upper limits of the pick-up current are entered. In this protection, for currents lower than I, the
                function does not give a pick-up regardless of the voltage. Also, for current higher than I, this
                function gives a pick-up regardless of
                the voltage. The range between these two values is where the voltage value is influential for the
                performance of the function. Voltage settings of this function is entered in VLN and VLL fields. As
                mentioned before, this function needs
                different settings for phase to earth and phase to phase faults. VLN is used for specifying phase to
                earth faults settings; VLN I and VLN I are used for specifying the voltage value of lower and upper
                limits respectively. VLL I and VLL
                I have the same function for phase to phase faults. Note that for VI Starting-Controlled function, the
                same value must be entered for the lower and upper limits of VLN and VLL. But for Restrained mode, the
                lower limit must be lower than
                the upper limit. Also, current and voltage tolerances of this function are entered in “Tolerances”
                section.

        <contant id="Shot_Test_tab">
            <Search>“SHOT TEST” TAB As mentioned previously, one of the windows in “VI Starting” room is “Test View”.
                This window has 6 tabs including “Shot Test”, “Check Test”, “Search Test”, “Setting”, “Trigger” and
                “Binary Output”. Specifying the test points
                is done in “Shot Test”, “Check Test” and “Search Test” tabs. / In “Shot Test” tab, you can select fault
                type and the points for the test and after the test is performed, you can view the results of the
                evaluation. In this tab, in “Test
                Point” section the fault current and voltage and in “Fault Type” section the fault type are determined.
                Voltage, fault current and the angle between voltage and current are entered in “Voltage”, “Current” and
                “Phi” tabs respectively. After
                specifying the current and voltage of the test, it is necessary to select the fault type from the
                standard faults available in “Fault Type” section. These faults include different fault types of phase
                to earth, two-phase and three-phase.
                / By clicking on “Add”, the selected test point is entered in the table in this window. By selecting one
                of the rows and then selecting “Insert” option, the selected row is repeated in the table and by
                clicking on “Remove”, the selected
                point is removed. By selecting “Add to” option, it is possible to copy point or points selected for a
                “Fault Type” to another “Fault Type”. By clicking on “Remove All”, all test points entered in the table
                are removed. / By clicking on
                “Sequence” option, “Sequence Test Points to” page opens where it is possible to create test points with
                equal steps. In “Step” section, steps are created toward the range. By selecting “Angle” in “Step On”
                field, angular steps are entered
                directly in terms of degrees. This means that the test points are entered according to the origin point
                specified in “Origin” section in a way that the required angles are resulted in accordance with the
                horizon. For example, if 45 and
                90 degrees are entered as start and end point with 5 degrees steps and 5 volts and 5 amps as origin
                point, by confirming this settings and “Zooming All” you can see that there are some points added on the
                “VI Characteristic”. For example,
                the last point is selected. By doing the calculations mentioned in the picture you can see that the
                resulted angle is 85 degrees and not 90 which is because the “Origin” point is considered as one of the
                points as well and the last point
                of this “Sequence” is removed. / But by selecting “Direction”, an angle is specified in “Angle” field
                and in this angle from the “Origin” point, with the length entered in “Length” field and by steps
                specified in “Step Size”, some points
                are shot on the curve. Note that the length and the steps of the points are specified according to
                nominal current which is the same as the “CT” secondary current entered in “Device” block on “Test
                Object” page. For example, if 45 degree,
                5 and 0.5 times the nominal current, 0 And 0 are entered as angle, length, step and origin point, by
                confirming this setting and “Zooming All”, you can see that some points are created in 45 degrees in the
                characteristic curve with 0 Volts
                and 0 Amps as the point of origin. / If the performed test has “Failed” points, by selecting “Clear All
                Failed Tests” option, these points are cleared from the table in this section. In “Detail” section, the
                information related to “Tip”
                nominal time, the allowed operation time range, the actual time and evaluation of test point are entered
                in “T nom”, “T min” and “T Max”, “T act” and “State” fields respectively. In the table at the bottom of
                the page, the test points
                are entered with various details. The details include test evaluation, test voltage, test current, the
                angle between voltage and current of the test point. Also, if you wish to enter a comment for any of the
                points, you can select “User

        <contant id="Check_Test_tab">
            <Search>“CHECK TEST” TAB After performing the “Shot Test” in “VI Starting” room, it is time to perform
                “Check Test” and “Search Test”. In “Check Test” the upper and lower tolerances of the relay that are
                displayed as dotted lines in “VI Starting Characteristic”
                are tested and evaluated. To perform the “Check Test”, first it is necessary to draw some lines named
                “Check Line” in different sections of the diagram. To draw this line, first in “Origin” section from
                “Check Line” section, the start
                point of this line is specified. In “Voltage”, “Current”, “Phi” and “Angle” fields, origin point
                voltage, origin point current, the angle between voltage and current and the movement angle of the
                “Check Line” are specified respectively.
                In “Length” section, the length of the “Check Line” is entered in the intended cell. / / Note that the
                drawn “Check Lines” must cross at least one of the tolerance lines of the point characteristic curve.
                Then click on “Add” option to
                add the “Check Line” to “Check Test” lines table. Another way to draw a “Check Line” is to hold down
                “Ctrl” button and left-click in “VI Starting Characteristic” window and then move the cursor in your
                desired direction on the characteristic
                curve. You can see that the information of the drawn “Check Line” is displayed in the “Check Test” lines
                table. After drawing the “Check Line”, the software evaluates the crossing point of the “Check Line” and
                the tolerance lines as a
                “Shot” test in accordance with the performance of the relay. Here, after performing the test, the relay
                performs a “PICK UP” in the lower tolerance and has no performance in the upper tolerance; so the test
                is “Passed”. Other parts of
                this section such as “Fault Type” and “Remove All”, “Sequencer” options etc. are similar to “Shot Test”
                section which has been explained in previous videos. The only additional option in this section is “Copy
                to Search”. By marking one
                of the test lines and selecting this option, you can copy the selected line to “Search Test” and by
                selecting “Add” in “Search Test”, this line is entered in the “Search Test” lines tables. / / After
                “Check Test”, the last test performed
                on the “VI Starting” characteristic curve is “Search Test”. The purpose of this test is to find the
                characteristic curve line and drawing method of the “Search Line” is the same as the two previous
                methods explained for “Check Line”. By
                performing the test, the software starts interpolating the characteristic curve by testing some points
                on the search line and determines the exact location of the characteristic curve. The number of points
                on the “Search Line” which are
                tested by the software is specified by the user in “Setting” tab in “Search Setting” section which is in
                fact the resolution of the “Search Test”. There are three “Relative”, “Absolute” and “Max Point Number”
                options in this section which
                determine the ending condition of the “Search Test”. The first condition is “Relative” meaning if the
                difference between the test point value and previous test point is less than the value specified in this
                field, this point is the response
                of the test. The second condition is “Absolute” meaning if the difference between the test point and
                previous point is less than the value specified in this field, this point is the response of the test.
                And the third condition is “Max
                Point Number” meaning the test cannot be performed more than the number of points entered in this field
                and the last point is the response of the test. / / “Ignore” field in “Search Interval” section is used
                when you want to ignore the
                characteristic curve specified for the intended search line. By entering a number in this section, some
                points are added on the “Search” line with the specified value as the distance between them. For
                example, by entering 0.4 in this field,
                you can see that some lines are added on the “Search Line” with a 0.4 distance. If the test is
                performed, the points added on the “Search Test” are tested one after the other so that the exact
                location of the characteristic curve is determined.
                This option is used when the characteristic curve that you have for the test seems wrong or you have no
                characteristic curve at all. If you wish to do this for all of the test lines, you can use “Ignore
                Nominal Characteristic” section
                located in the “Setting” tab. To do this, by entering the value for “Search Interval” and selecting
                “Apply to all”, you can apply this settings to all of the test lines and find the relay characteristic
                curve. /

        <contant id="VI_Starting_Room_Setting">
            <Search>"VI STARTING" ROOM SETTING To continue with explaining “VI Starting” room, in this video we are
                going to explain “Setting” tab. you can adjust some of the test settings. In this tab, In “Time”
                section, first, the injection time before fault
                in “PreFault Time” is entered. In “Max Fault Time”, the maximum fault injection time is specified in the
                form of “Abs” or “Rel” which itself includes three sections. Note that if the time specified in “Max
                Fault Time” is shorter than time
                of the “Pick up” time of the shot point, result of the evaluation will be wrong. / If you are using “Max
                Fault Time Abs” field, you need to enter a time in terms of seconds for the maximum fault signal
                injection time for all points. But,
                to increase the speed of the test, you can use “Max Fault Time Rel”. By checking this option, three
                other options appear. By entering a number in “Add%ofTnom”, the fault signal injection time in each
                point equals the test point nominal
                time plus a percentage of the nominal time entered in this field. This means that if the test point
                nominal time is 10 seconds and 5 percent is entered in this field, the maximum fault injection time 105
                percent of the test nominal time
                which is 10.5 seconds. But in “Add Absolute” field, the fault injection time is entered as a sum of the
                test point trip nominal time plus the time entered in this field. For points which are in “No Trip”
                area, it is possible to enter a
                separate time in “No-Trip Time” field. If you enter the time in these four fields, the software will
                consider the longest time. “Post Fault” time is entered in “Post Fault Time”. “Delay After Trigger” is
                used for specifying the trigger
                time of the intended key and by right-clicking on the related field and selecting “Go To Linked Value”,
                you can see that it is linked to “CB Trip Time” and if necessary, by selecting “Remove Link” you can
                enter your desired value instead.
                In “Load Current PreFault Current” section, it is possible to adjust the settings related to “PreFault”
                phase and current. By selecting “Based on Current” radio button in “Amplitude” section, the “PreFault”
                current is entered in ampere
                which is the same for all other test points. But, by selecting “Based on IFault”, the “PreFault” current
                is entered in fault current which is different for every “Shot” point. You can use “Phase” section for
                the angle between current and
                voltage in “PreFault”. By selecting the “Based on Degree” radio button, it is possible to specify the
                voltage current angle in degrees which is the same for all other test points. But, by selecting “Same as
                Fault Angle”, the angle between
                current and voltage in “PreFault” will be the same with “Fault” which is different for every “Shot”
                point. / In “Search Setting” section, the settings related to “Search Test” are specified. As mentioned
                before, “Search Test” gives a result
                when one of these conditions are met. The first condition is “Relative” meaning if the difference
                between the test point value and previous test point is less than the percentage specified in this
                field, this point is the response of the
                test. The second condition is “Absolute” meaning if the difference between the test point and previous
                point is less than the value specified in this field, this point is the response of the test. And the
                third condition is “Max Point
                Number” meaning the test cannot be performed more than the number of points entered in this field and
                the last point is the response of the test. But, if for any reasons, the nominal characteristic
                specified for the test is not available,
                you can use the “Ignore Nominal Characteristic” section. By doing so, the software ignores the current
                characteristic. Then, according to the steps entered in “Search Interval”, shots are added to the
                "Search" line. For example, in “Search
                Test” section, a line is drawn. Then, 0.5 is entered in “Search Interval” and “Apply to all” is
                selected. You can see that points with this step are shot on the “Search” line. By performing the test,
                you can see that it starts from the
                lowest point and when one of the three mentioned conditions is met, the test gives a result. If
                necessary, it is possible to disable this option by selecting “Disable all”. In “Trigger” tab, you can
                select your intended binary to receive
                the “Pick up” signal, cutting the injection of current and voltage. The explanation and settings of this
                section are the same as those for “Trigger” in “Sequencer” room. In “Binary Output” tab, if it is
                necessary for the relay to see the
                key condition, by using the “A” or “B” group voltages or “Aux DC” it is possible to take any needed
                voltage to the “Binary Input” of the relay through “Binary Output” of the device. This tab has three
                “PreFault”, Fault” and “Post Fault”
                modes and you can specify the settings of each one separately. / /

            <Search>INTRODUCING “DISTANCE” ROOM, PART 1 The relays impedance characteristic test is performed in “AMT
                Distance” room. The most important use of this room is to test distance relays and “Under Excitation”.
                Distance relays and “Under Excitation”
                are used to protect the transmission lines and generators respectively. For example in this video two
                “Mho” zones are drawn which are displayed in “Impedance View” window. Distance room consists of 4 main
                windows including “Test View”,
                “Impedance View”, “Z-T Diagram” and “Medium Detail View”. “Shot Test”, “Check Test” and “Search Test”
                are performed in “Test-View” window. In “Impedance View” window the impedance characteristic of the
                relay is displayed according to the
                information entered in “Test Object” in terms of “X” and “R” and based on “CT” and “PT” secondary
                values. This is why in this window the horizontal and vertical axes are named “Secondary R” and
                “Secondary X”. To view the impedance characteristic
                based on the primary you can select “Primary Values” from the toolbar. In “Z-T Diagram” the
                time-impedance curve is displayed. If this window is open along with “Impedance View” and “Test View”
                windows, by adding a shot on the curve or
                selecting a point from the table, the location of that point is displayed on “ZT” curve. In “Medium
                Detail View” window the characteristics of the shot point and protective zones are displayed. / As
                mentioned before, to test the relay
                first it is necessary to enter its information in “Test Object” window. Information such as nominal
                information of the relay, serial number, operation location of the relay, “CT” and “PT” characteristics
                are entered in “Device” block.
                This section has been thoroughly explained in previous videos. But the main block in this room is
                “Distance” by double-clicking on which, the “Distance Protection Parameters” window opens. Two tabs of
                “System Settings” and “Zone Settings”
                where the settings is entered are available in this window. / “System Settings” Tab The characteristics
                of the power system are entered in “System Settings” tab. In “System Parameters” section, the length of
                the line is entered in terms
                of ohm in “Line Length” field while the angle of the line is entered in “Line Angle” field. In “PT
                Connection” field, the installation method of the voltage transformer is selected from among “at line”
                and “at Busbar” states. The installation
                method of the PT Voltage transformer specifies whether the voltage exists in “PostFault” which refers to
                the time after the fault. If “at Line” option is selected, after switching the circuit breaker, the
                input voltage line of the relay
                equals zero and the “AMT” device will not make any voltage into the relay in “PostFault”. But by
                selecting “at Busbar” option, after switching the circuit breaker, the input voltage line of the relay
                keeps its nominal value and consequently,
                the “AMT” device injects the relay with nominal voltage in “PostFault”. / / In “CT StarPoint” field, the
                direction of the connection is selected from among “Dir. Line” and “Dir.Busbar” states. If the
                connection is “Dr. Line”, the current
                flows from device to the relay. If the relay connection is “Dir. Busbar”, it is only enough that the
                current angle is changed as much as 180 degrees. / / Then, in “Tolerance” section, time and impedance
                tolerances are specified. In this
                field, first the time tolerances are entered in terms of percentage and time in “Tol.T rel” and “Tol.T
                abs” respectively. Then impedance tolerances are entered in “Tol.Z rel” and “Tol.Z abs” fields in terms
                of percentage and ohm respectively.
                / “Grounding Factor” Section: In this section, the grounding factor for phase-to-ground fault is
                specified. In phase-to-ground faults, specifying this number in accordance with the relay algorithm is
                so important. If this factor is wrong,
                the calculations of the phase-to-ground fault will be wrong as well. So, one of the methods mentioned is
                this section should be selected in accordance with the algorithm used by the relay to calculate the
                single phase-to-ground fault.
                The output voltage and current fault of the device will change in accordance with the selected checkbox
                in the “Mode” field. Any of these options should be selected considering the type of the relay being
                tested. The used algorithms can
                be divided into three groups of “Type A”, “Type B” and “Type C” in accordance with the different types
                of relays and algorithms used to calculate the fault impedance. If none of the checkboxes is selected,
                “Type A” is selected by default.
                If you do not know the type of algorithm being used by the relay you are testing, it is better to use
                trial and error method. / “Mode” Field There are various modes to enter the grounding factor values in
                this section. It is only necessary
                to select a mode and enter the values accordingly. By entering the grounding factor in this section, the
                software calculates the impedance for phase-to-ground fault. If in the relay being tested, the grounding
                factor is indicated by “KL”,
                the “KL” value should be entered in “KL Magnitude” cell and its angle should be entered in “KL Angle”
                cell. But if the grounding factor is indicated by “RE/RL” and “XE/XL”, you can select this mode and
                enter the required values in “RE/RL”
                and “XE/XL” fields. “RE” and “XE” stand for true and imaginary values of the ground impedance from to
                the relay location to the fault and “RL” and “XL” stand for the true and imaginary values of line
                impedance from the relay location to
                the fault. If in the relay being tested the ground factor values is indicated by “Z0/Z1”, you can select
                this mode and enter the “Z0/Z1” value and its angle in “Z0/Z1 Magnitude” and “Z0/Z1 Angle” fields
                respectively. “Z0” indicates the
                zero sequence impedance while “Z1” is indicator of the positive sequence impedance of the faulty line. /
                / / “Calc. With RE/RL and XE/XL” Option If this option is checked, “Type B” formulae are used to
                calculate the ground factor and its
                effect on the current and voltage produced by the device. In these relays, to calculate the impedance in
                phase-to-ground fault, “Kr” and “Kx” factors are used which are “Kr=RE/RL” and “Kx=XE/XL”. / “Separate
                Arc Resistance” Option / “Impedance
                in Primary Values” Option In some relays, the characteristic is based on the primary values. But since
                it is necessary to enter the characteristics in the software based on secondary values so that the
                device can apply the voltage and
                current in accordance with the relay characteristic, you should enter the primary values in the software
                and check “Impedance in Primary Values” option. By doing so, the values are multiplied by the turns
                ratio of current and voltage transformers.
                / “LL Fault Group Exclude L1L2L3 Fault Type” Option This option is used to separate two-phase fault from
                three-phase fault. Generally, because of “Grounding Factor” in relays, there is difference between the
                characteristic curves of “L-E”
                and “LL” faults. But it is possible that in some relays there is also difference between two-phase and
                three-phase faults in which case, this option should be used. By checking this option, it is necessary
                to specify the three-phase fault
                zones in “Fault Loop” column. More explanation on this section will be provided in future videos.
                “Impedance Correction 1A/1nom” option is used when the relay’s “CT” is “5 amps” but in the calculations
                a “1 amp” “CT” is used for it. By
                checking this option, you can use the new turns ratio. /

            <Search>INTRODUCING “DISTANCE” ROOM, PART 2 In “Zone Setting” tab and in “Zones” section, the information is
                entered to each “Zone”. By using the “New” option, it is possible to add a row or “Zone” to the table of
                this section and to repeat a zone,
                delete a zone or enter the characteristics of each “Zone” you can use “Add Duplicate”, “Delete” and
                “Edit” options respectively. / To enter the characteristics of a “Zone”, by clicking on “Add” add one or
                several rows and specify your
                zone. Using this table, you can draw the desired characteristics. For polygon characteristics you need
                to use several “Lines” and enter the characteristics of each of the sides. For each line, “R”, “X”,
                “Angle angle of the line” and “Inside
                the inside area” should be specified which includes “Left” for the area of the left side and above the
                line for horizontal lines and “Right” and below the line for horizontal lines. In using “Line polar”,
                the line characteristics are specified
                with its impedance magnitude and angle which means “Z” and “Phi”. If you wish to draw radial
                characteristics, you need to use “Arc”. In “Arc” mode, you need to enter the center of the circle, the
                radius of the circle, the start angle of
                the curve and the end angle of the curve in “R” and “X”, “Radius”, “Start angle” and “End angle”
                respectively. Moreover, you can select the rotation direction of the curve from among “Clockwise” and
                “Counter clockwise” options. If you
                are using “Arc Polar”, instead of “R” and “X”, you need to enter impedance and angle. / As an example,
                we are going to show you how to draw a “Quad” characteristic and in future videos we will provide you
                with explanations for other characteristics.
                Before starting to design the zones, it is important to note that intersection of successive lines with
                each other, meaning the intersection of the first and second lines, second and third lines, and third
                and fourth lines so one. make
                the zone. Finally, if you check “Auto Close” option, the intersections of the first and last lines will
                be considered as well and the zone will close automatically. / To begin an element, “Add” “Line
                Cartesian” and set its “R” and “X”
                at “0” and “-0.1” respectively with a “0” angle. By adding the next line, the intersection point of
                these two lines determines the zone area. “R” and “X” of the second line are “1” and “0” with a “65”
                angle. Since “Left” has been selected,
                the inside area of the left side is selected. By selecting “Right”, you can see that the right side of
                the line from the intersection point is considered as a part of the zone. To specify the line above the
                characteristic, a line with
                “0” as “R” and “1” as “X” with a “0” angle and “Right” to select below the line is entered. In the final
                step, a line with “65” as its angle and “-1” and “0” as its “R” and “X” are entered. / As another
                example, if you wish to make a radial
                zone, you need to use “Arc Cartesian”. If you just want to make a circular zone with a specified center
                and radius, you need to enter the center of the circle and its radius in “R” and “X” and “Radius” fields
                respectively. Here, as an
                example, “1”, “0” and “1” are entered as the center and radius. “Start Angle”, “End Angle” and
                “Direction” fields have no effect in this mode. In “Inside” field, by selecting “Left” or “Right” you
                can select inside or outside the circle
                as the zone respectively. If you wish to specify a part of the circle as the zone, first you need to
                specify a line and then a circle. If you enter “15” degrees as the angle of the first line, and set the
                rotation direction of the circle
                at “Counter Clockwise”, the software starts moving in counter clockwise direction and picks the first
                intersection of the line and the circle which is close to the “Start Angle” as the start angle and picks
                another intersection which is
                close to the “End Angle” and the end angle. To complement the explanation, another line is added. This
                line determines the end angle and the first line of the start angle. Like before, the rule is that the
                intersection which is close to
                the “End Angle” is considered as the end angle. For example, “25” degrees is entered. According to the
                provided explanations, if you wish to select a part of the circle as the zone, you need to specify the
                circular element between the
                two line where the first line is the start angle and the second line is the end angle. /

        <contant id="Introducing_Distance_Room_Part3">
            <Search>INTRODUCING “DISTANCE” ROOM, PART 3 To simplify drawing the zones you can use “Predefined Shapes”.
                In this section, some patterns are predefined for three types of characteristics. Circle is used to draw
                “MHO” characteristic curves. In “Forward
                Reach” field, the maximum forward protective area is specified which is in “R” positive direction. If
                the characteristic is in a way that covers a part of the back of the relay, by using the “Offset” field,
                you can apply this item as well.
                About the mentioned subject, note that applying offset does not cause “Forward Reach” to change.
                Moreover, it is also possible to apply negative offset, which causes the characteristic to distance from
                the origin of the coordinates. By
                entering the angle in the “Angle” field, the center of the circle moves in counter clockwise direction
                as much as the value mentioned in this field. For example, if “5” and “1” are entered as “Forward Reach”
                and “Offset” respectively,
                in “0” degree you can see that “R=-1 to “R=5” is the area that is covered. Now, if “45” is entered as
                the angle, you see that the center of the circle rotates as much as “45” degrees. In this case, the
                radius and center of the circle can
                be obtained using “r=forward Reach + Offset/2"And “M=forward Reach + Offset/2”formula respectively.
                “Polygon” characteristic are made of four line Cartesians. To change any of the sides, first you need to
                select the intended line and enter
                the characteristics. Explanations for this matter are the same as the explanations provided for line
                Cartesian. / The last characteristic is “Lens/Tomato”. The use of “Forward Reach”, “Offset” and “Angle”
                fields is the same as “MHO” characteristic.
                Parameters “A” and “B” stand for “Width” and “Forward Reach” respectively and in “A/B” field the
                proportion of these two is entered. If “A/B” is bigger than “1”, smaller than “1” or equalls “1”, the
                characteristic will be in tomato form,
                lens form and MHO form respectively. If “A/B” is selected in the “Type” field, by changing the “Forward
                Reach”, the proportion of “A/B” remains the same and the “Width” changes. For example you can see that
                if “A/B” equals “0.5”, by changing
                “Forward Reach” the value of “Width” changes. However, if “Width” is selected as “Type”, by changing
                “Forward Reach”, you see that the “Width” remains the same and “A/B” changes. / Practically this
                characteristic curve is made of “2” circles
                and the radius of these circles is shown as the “R” formula, the center of the first circle is shown as
                “M1”, and the center of the second circle is in the form of “M2” where “α”, “β” and “ϕ” are as
                illustrated. / / In the end, some points
                about this section is mentioned: By selecting any element, any information entered earlier will be
                deleted. By checking “Invert all” option, the selected area inverses. This means that if this option is
                checked and “1” second is entered
                as the trip time, on the test page you can see that inside the curve is “NO TRIP” while outside the
                curve is “Tripping” area. / By clicking on “Clear” on this page, all information will be deleted. /
                After specifying the zone, the type
                of the zone should be specified in “Type” field. If “Tripping” is selected, its trip time and time and
                impedance tolerances should be entered in “Zone Details” and for changing any tolerance, its checkbox
                should be checked and then the
                changes can be made. Generally, starting zones are very big, which contain tripping zones, and the
                condition which the relay performs a trip is that the fault impedance is located not only in the
                tripping area but also inside the starting
                area. “Extended” zones are those that are activated by receiving a specific signal from the network and
                usually cause the zone cover a bigger part of the line. / In “Fault Loop” field you can specify the type
                of faults that the defined
                zone can be used for. To specify that a zone is to be used only for two-phase faults you need to select
                “LL” in “Fault Loop” field and check “LL Fault Group Exclude L1L2L3 fault Type” in “System Setting”. You
                can use “Active” column to
                activate or deactivate a zone. / “Up” and “Down” options at the top of the table are used to move the
                defined zones. At the bottom of the page there is a box including grounding factor by which makes it
                possible to specify a different
                single-phase grounding factor for each zone. However, this section is in progress and is not ready for
                use yet. /

        <contant id="Introducing_Test_View_window_in_Distance_room_Part1">
            <Search>INTRODUCING “TEST VIEW” WINDOW IN “DISTANCE” ROOM, PART 1 As mentioned before, one of the windows of
                “Distance” room is “Test View”. This window consists of 6 tabs of “Shot Test”, “Check Test”, “Search
                Test”, “Setting”, “Trigger” and “Binary
                Output”. In “Shot Test” tab, it is possible to specify fault type and test point and after performing
                the test, you can view the results of the evaluation. In “Test Point” section in this tab, the test
                point can be specified using two
                methods: first, the impedance magnitude is entered in “lZl” field in terms of ohm and in “Phi” field the
                impedance angle is entered in terms of degree. Then, by clicking on “Add” the values are entered and the
                software displays the real
                and imaginary values of this impedance in “R” and “X” fields respectively. In the second method, it is
                possible to directly enter the real and imaginary values in “R” and “X” fields and by selecting “Add”
                select your intended point. If
                you wish to enter your test points in terms of a percentage of length of the line, you should use “%”
                field. / By checking “Z Relative” option, the test point is made dependent on the length of the line and
                recorded in the table. By changing
                the length of the line from 1 to 3 ohms, in “Test Object” section, in “Distance Parameters” window in
                “System Settings”, the entered impedance value is changed in accordance with the length of the line.
                But, if this option is not checked,
                by changing the length of the line, the entered values in the table do not change. In fact, each test
                point consists of three “States” which simulate “Prefault”, “Fault” and “Post Fault” states. By default,
                in “Prefault”, “Fault” and “Post
                Fault”, nominal voltage and 0current, 0 voltage and current and voltage and a current based on the test
                point are injected respectively. To change “Prefault” and “Post Fault” states you should use “Setting”
                tab and “Time” section. More
                explanation about this section will be provided in “Setting” videos. Just note that if PT connection is
                wired, as at busbar, in “Post Fault” the zero current and nominal voltage will be available. / The Fault
                Type is specified in “Fault
                Type” section. These Faults include phase to ground, two-phase and three-phase faults. Before specifying
                the fault type and fault current, it is necessary to select the test model from among Constance test
                current, Constance test voltage
                and Constance source impedance. In Constance test current model the injection current is fixed and the
                voltage changes in accordance with the test impedance. In Constance test voltage model, the test voltage
                is fixed and the fault current
                changes in accordance with the test impedance. In Constance source impedance method, the source
                impedance includes the impedance from the origin to fault plus the impedance of ground to the fault
                point, angle and the grounding factor.
                / By selecting “Add”, the selected test point is added to the table in this window. By selecting any of
                the rows and clicking on “Insert” option, the selected row is repeated in the table and by clicking on
                “Remove”, the selected point
                is removed. By selecting “Add to” option, it is possible to copy the point or points selected for one of
                the “Fault Types” to another “Fault Type”. By selecting “Remove All” option, it is possible to remove
                all of the test points added
                to the table. By clicking on “Sequence” option, “Sequence Test Points To” page opens where it is
                possible to create test points with equal steps. By selecting “Angle” in “Step On” field in “Step”
                section, the angular steps are directly
                entered in terms of degrees. / This means that the test points are specified according to the “Origin”
                point entered in “Origin” section in a way that the required angles resulted in proportion to the
                horizon. For example if the start
                and end angles equal “45” and “90” degrees with “5” degrees as their steps and the origin points are
                entered for “Z” and “Phi” or “R” and “X”, after selecting “5” ohms as impedance and “36” degrees as the
                origin and by applying this settings,
                you can see that multiple points are added on the “Impedance View”. For example the last point is
                selected; you can see that the resulted angle is “85” degrees not “90” degrees. This happens because the
                “Origin” point is also considered
                as one of the points. / But by selecting “Direction”, an “angle” is specified in “Angle” field where
                from the “Origin” point with the length entered in “Length” field and with steps specified in “Step
                Size”, some points are shot on the
                characteristic curve. Note that the length and the steps of the points are in terms of ohm. For example
                if the angle is “45” degrees, the length is “5”, the step size is “0.5” ohm and the origin point is “0”
                ohm, by applying this settings
                you can see that some points are created in “45” degrees with “0” origin in “Impedance View”. Note that
                in both states of “Angle” and “Direction”, it is possible to make the origin dependent on the length of
                the line and specify it in
                form of a percentage of it in “Z Relative” section. / If the performed test has “Failed” points, by
                selecting “Clear All Failed Tests” option, it is possible to clear the results of all these points. In
                “Detail” section, the information
                related to “Trip” nominal time, the allowed operation time range, actual time and test point evaluation
                are entered in “T nom”, “T min” “T max”, “T act” and “State” fields respectively. The test points are
                entered with detail in the table
                at the bottom of the page. The details include test evaluation, test current, nominal time, operation
                time, fault value in terms of percent and seconds and the minimum and maximum operation time. Also, if
                you wish to add a comment about
                any of the test points, you can use the “User Comment” cell. At the bottom of this page, it is possible
                to select test points table from different “Fault Types”. To test, a point is shot in “L1-E” “Fault
                Type”. By using “Add to” option,
                this point is also added to “L1L2” and “L1L2L3” “Fault Types”. Note that if “L1-E” option remains
                checked, the point added for the “L1-E” “Fault Type” will be repeated in this “Fault Type”. Then, open
                the “Signal View” window and run the
                test. You can see how the voltage and current signals are injected for every test point. After testing
                each point, its evaluation is recorded in the table as well as the “Impedance View”. /

            <Search>“CHECK TEST” TAB After performing “Shot Test” in “Distance” room, it is time to do “Check Test” and
                “Search Test”. In “Check Test” the upper and lower tolerances of the relay which are displayed as dotted
                line in “Impedance View” are tested
                and evaluated. To perform a “Check Test”, first it is necessary to draw lines named “Check Line” in
                different parts of the diagram. To draw this line first from “Check Line” section, the origin point of
                this line is specified in “Origin”.
                In “|Z|” field the test impedance value is entered as a number. Note that if a negative number , for
                example -2.5 is entered, since there is no negative impedance, this negative value will influence the
                angle; this means that it will be
                subtracted from 180 degrees angle in “Phi” field. The impedance angle is entered within the range of
                -180 to 180 in “Phi” field and if in this cell a number higher than this range is entered, automatically
                that number will be displayed
                in the specified range. For example if 455 degrees is entered in this field, 95 degrees will be
                displayed. / In addition to using |Z| & "Phi" filed, you can specify origin impedance using "R" & "X"
                fields. "R" & "X" are real and imaginary
                of impedance. In fact the four fields of “|Z|”, “Phi”, “R” and “X” are linked and by changing the value
                of one of them, the others change accordingly. In “Angle” field the angle of the “Check Line” and In the
                cell of the “Length” section
                the length of the “Check Line” is entered. In “%” field it is possible to specify the length of “Check
                Line” in terms of a percentage of the length specified in “Test Object” by default. By enabling the
                “Relative” option, you can make
                the length of the line dependent on the parameter specified in “of” field. The value of the parameter
                specified in “of” field is multiplied by the value of the “%” field and the length of the line is
                formed. If “Relative” is checked, by
                changing the value of the “of” parameter, the value of the “%” cell does not change and the new value of
                the “Length” is calculated. If “Relative” checkbox is not enabled and the value of “of” parameter is
                changed, the value of “Length”
                field remains fixed and the value of the “%” changes. Note that the drawn “Check Lines” need to have an
                intersection with at least one of the tolerance lines of the characteristic curve. Then, click on “Add”
                option so that the “Check Line”
                is added to the “Check Test” lines table. / Another method for drawing the “Check Line” is to hold down
                the left-click and “Ctrl” key on “Impedance View” window and then move the cursor in the desired
                direction on the characteristic curve.
                You can see that the information of the drawn “Check Line” is displayed in “Check Test” lines table.
                After drawing the “Check Line”, the software evaluates the crossing place of “Check Line” and tolerance
                lines as “Shot” test in accordance
                with the performance of the relay. Here, after performing the test, the relay does not perform in upper
                tolerance and performs a trip in the lower tolerance so the result of the test is “Passed”. Other parts
                of this section such as “Fault
                Type” and “Remove All” and “Sequence” etc. options are the same at those of “Shot Test” section which
                have been explained in previous videos. The only additional option in this section is “Copy to Search”.
                By marking any of the test lines
                and selecting this option, it is possible to copy the selected line in “Search Test” and by selecting
                “Add” option in “Search Test”, add this line to the “Search Test” test lines table. /

            <Search>“SEARCH TEST” TAB After performing “Shot Test” and “Check Test” in “Distance” room, it is time to do
                “Search Test”. The purpose of this test is to find the Exact location of characteristic curve line .To
                perform a “Search Test”, first it is
                necessary to draw lines named “Search Line” in different parts of the diagram which is the same as the
                method explained for “Check Line”. And all of mentioned notes for check line is true for search line
                too. After drawing the “Search
                Line”, the software evaluates the crossing place of “Search Line” and tolerance lines as “Shot” test in
                accordance with the performance of the relay. By performing the test, the software interpolates the
                characteristic curve by testing
                some points on the search line to find the exact location of the characteristic curve. Other parts of
                this section such as “Fault Type” and “Remove All” and “Sequence” etc. options are the same at those of
                “Shot Test” section which have
                been explained in previous videos. The ignore field in the “Search Interval” is used when defined
                characteristic curve is not considered for the search line. / By entering a number in this section, some
                points are added on the “Search”
                line with the entered number as their distance. For example, by entering “150mΩ” in this field, you can
                see that there are points added on the “Search Line” with as much as “150m“of distance. If the test is
                performed, the points added
                on the “Search Line” are tested one after the other so that the exact location of the relay is
                specified. This option is used when there is no characteristic curve for the test or the current
                characteristics seem to be wrong. If you want
                to do this for all drawn test lines, you can use the “Setting” tab in “Ignore Nominal Characteristic”
                section. To do so, by entering the value of “Search Interval” and selecting “Apply to all” option, you
                can apply this settings to all
                test lines and find the relay characteristic. /

        <contant id="Distance_room_settings_Part1">
            <Search>“DISTANCE” ROOM SETTINGS, PART 1 In “Settings” tab it is possible for you to manage settings related
                to “Shot Test”, “Check Test” and “Search Test”. In “Fault” section, the method of the test is specified.
                In addition to the test method, the
                amount of current or voltage of the test is specified as well. Generally, there are three methods to
                calculate the test current and voltage and all of these methods are available in the drop-down list in
                “Test Model”. The first method
                is “Constant test current”. After specifying the fault impedance, the test voltage can be easily
                calculated in a fixed current. Some of the parameters are set in accordance with the option selected in
                this field about which more be discussed
                later. / The amount of test current is specified in “I Test” field. As you can see this cell is in
                Purple which means that its value is dependent on a parameter in “Test Object” and is calculated using
                the relation defined for it. By right-clicking
                on this option and selecting “Link to XRio” you can see that the amount of test current is resulted from
                multiplying the nominal current by 2. You are allowed to change this number to any desired value. By
                manually changing this value,
                the cell turns pink if “XRio” file is loaded which means that the formula of calculating the test
                current is disabled. You can also enter the test current value manually by right-clicking on this cell
                and selecting “Remove Link” option.
                / “LL Same as LE” option enables the user to test either of phase to ground and phase to phase fault
                types with different currents. If this option is checked, all phase to ground and phase to phase fault
                types are tested with the same
                current and if this option is unchecked, you can specify a test current for each of fault types. When
                using the Constant test current test method, in “Maximum Fault Impedance” section, the maximum fault
                impedance in phase to ground, two-phase
                and three-phase “Fault Types” is calculated by using these formulae and are displayed. / If in constant
                current, the test voltage is more than the nominal value of the relay a prompt saying “Out Of Range” is
                displayed which means that
                the selected point is out of the allowed range. By checking “Allow Reduction of I Test” option, the
                software considers the voltage as the nominal value to calculate the intended impedance current and
                voltage and decreases the current value
                so that the shot point is placed in the injection range of the device. By checking “Allow Reduction of I
                Test” option, “V Max L-L” field is displayed which is the same as the nominal line voltage. You can see
                that this cell is in Purple
                which means its value is related to another parameter. By right-clicking on this field and selecting “Go
                to Linked Value”, you can see that this field is linked to “V nom” parameter and by changing this
                parameter the value of this field
                changes accordingly. Also, by right-clicking on this cell and selecting “Remove Link” option, you can
                enter this value manually. For example, in “Shot Test” tab, a point with a “30” ohm impedance is added
                to the points table. This point
                is located in the “Out Of Range” area and by opening “Vector View” window, the voltage and current
                values for this impedance are displayed. By checking “Allow Reduction of I Test” option, you can see
                that the voltage value changes to nominal
                voltage and the current value is reduced so that this point is placed in the injection range of the
                device. Note that when you are testing a wide range of the zone, the injected current must be bigger
                than the minimum “Pick up” current
                of the relay. If the relay uses the voltage dependent on the inception current, make sure that the test
                voltage is always smaller than the “Pick up” voltage set for the relay. / The second method is “Constant
                test voltage”. By specifying
                the fault impedance value and keeping the voltage fixed, the test current can easily be calculated. Some
                of the parameters are set in accordance with the option selected in this section about which more is
                going to be said. The test voltage
                value is specified in “V Test” field and the value entered in this section is considered to be fixed
                throughout the test. When you are using the Constant test voltage test method, in “Minimum Fault
                Impedance” section, the minimum fault
                impedance in phase to ground, two-phase and three-phase “Fault Types” is calculated using these formulae
                and displayed. / / / The third method is “Constant Source Impedance”. In this method, it is possible to
                specify the fault impedance
                source so that the test current value is calculated by using a constant impedance. You can use various
                modes available in “Mode” drop-down list to determine the fault Source type. By clicking on this field a
                list opens where you can select
                your impedance model and enter the value of the required parameters in “Source Type” table in accordance
                with the selected model. / In “Zs and KS”, “ZS1 and ZS0”, “RS, Xs, RSE, XSE” and “SIR and KS” modes,
                magnitude and angle of the source
                impedance and the grounding factor of the impedance, magnitude and angle of the source impedance in zero
                and positive sequence, real and imaginary sections of the source impedance as well as the relation of
                mentioned real and imaginary
                parameters, and magnitude and angle value of real and imaginary sections of the source impedance are
                entered respectively. In fact, in this section, “SIR” is “ZS/ZL”. In “Ssc and X/R” and “Isc and X/R”
                modes, the short circuit apparent
                power for three-phase and phase to ground mode and the “X/R” parameter relation in single-phase mode,
                and the short circuit current for three-phase and phase to ground and the “X/R” parameter relation in
                single phase mode are entered in
                “Source Type” table respectively. / If “KS=KL” option is checked, in the models mentioned in “Mode”
                field numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 only the first two parameters are adjustable and the other two parameters
                are disabled. This option is disabled
                in modes 5 and 6. By setting the parameters of any of the selected models, the software calculates the
                current or voltage value for the test which can be viewed in “Vector View” window. / In “Fault
                Inception” section, the fault inception
                angle can be determined in three ways. To better understand this, open “Signal View” window. If “Fixed
                Angle” is selected from “Model” slide field, you can enter the desired fault inception angle value in
                “Angle” field and view the angle
                changes in “Signal View”. By entering this angle, current and voltage phases shift at the same amount.
                By selecting “Maximum Offset” option, the software picks the maximum “DC Offset” value in the fault
                inception moment for the current
                waveform. The maximum positive “DC Offset” value occurs when the fault inception angle is equal to the
                impedance angle ±90 degrees. By selecting “Zero offset” option, a zero “DC offset” is applied to the
                current output. By checking “DC
                offset” option, in “Fixed Angle” it is possible to specify a “DC offset” value for the current output in
                the fault inception moment in any desired angle. / If for any reason you wish to use the group B voltage
                output in “Distance” test,
                you can do so by checking “Enable Voltage Output VB” in “Voltage Output” section and entering the
                intended voltage and angle values. You can view the waveform related to this voltage output in “Signal
                View” window. /

            <Search>“DISTANCE” ROOM SETTINGS, PART 2 In “Time” section, first the injection time before the fault is
                entered in “Prefault Time”. In cases where the “PTs” draw inrush current, by checking “Ramp in Prefault”
                option, it is possible to increase the
                waveform of the voltage signal in prefault in form of a ramp to prevent stop applying voltage because of
                the drawn inrush current. In “Max Fault Time”, the maximum fault injection time is specified in form of
                “Abs” or “Rel” which itself
                consists of three parts. Note that if in a “Shot” point, the “Max Fault Time” is shorter than maximum
                allowed “Trip” time, the result of the evaluation will be wrong. If you are using the “Max Fault Time
                Abs” field, you need to enter a
                time in seconds for the maximum fault injection time For all points; but to increase the test speed, you
                can use “Max Fault Time Rel” option. / By checking this option three other options appear. By entering a
                number in “Add %of Tnom”,
                the fault injection time in every point equals the test point nominal time plus percentage of the
                nominal time entered in this field. This means that if the test point nominal time is 10 seconds and 5
                percent is entered in this field,
                the maximum fault injection time equals 105 percent of the test nominal time which is 10.5 seconds. But
                in “Add Absolute” field, the fault injection time is entered as the sum of test point nominal trip time
                plus the time entered in this
                field. If time is entered in these 3 fields, the software picks the highest value. For points that are
                in “No Trip” zone, it is possible to enter a separate time in “No-Trip Time” field. / In “Post Fault
                Time”, the injection time after
                the fault is entered. “Delay after Trigger”, is used to enter the key trigger time. By right-clicking on
                the related field and selecting “Go to Linked Value”, you can see that it is linked to “CB Trip Time”
                and if necessary, you can replace
                it with your desired value by selecting “Remove Link”. In “Time Reference”, by selecting “Fault
                Inception”, the “Trip” time is calculated from when the fault is injected. But by selecting “Starting”,
                the “Trip” is calculated from when
                the “Pick-up” contact is received from the relay. In “Load Current PreFault Current” section you can
                specify the settings for the phase and current related to “PreFault”. In “Amplitude” section, by
                selecting “Based on Current” radio button,
                the “PreFault” current is entered in terms of Ampere which is the same for all test points. But by
                selecting “Based on IFault”, the “PreFault” current is entered according to the fault current which is
                different for every “Shot” point.
                In “Phase” section, by selecting “Based on Degree” radio button, the current angle in “Prefault” is
                entered which is the same for all “Shot” point but by selecting “Same as Fault Angle” radio button, the
                “Prefault current angle” is the
                same as the fault current angle which is different for every “Shot” point. / In “Search Setting”
                section, the settings related to “Search Test” are specified. As mentioned before, a “Search Test”
                arrives at a conclusion only if one of
                the three conditions of this section is met. The first condition is “Relative” which means that if the
                difference between the test point value and the previous point is less than the percentage specified in
                this field, this very point
                is the result of the test. The second condition is “Absolute” which means that if the difference between
                the test point and the previous point is less than the value specified in this field, this very point is
                the result of the test. The
                third condition is “Max point number” which means that the test is to be performed as many times as the
                number of points entered in this field at max and the last point is the result of the test. But if for
                any reason, the nominal characteristic
                determined for the relay is not available, you can use “Ignore Nominal Characteristic” section. By doing
                so, the software ignores the existing characteristic. Then, based on the step entered in “Search
                Interval”, it adds shots on the “Search”
                line. For example, a line is drawn in “Search Test” section. Then, "200mΩ" is entered as the value for
                “Search Interval” and “Apply to all” is selected. You can see that some points with the same step are
                added on the “Search” line. By
                running the test, you can see that the test starts from the lowest point and once one of the three
                mentioned conditions is met, the test comes to result. Also, if necessary, you can ignore this option by
                selecting “Disable all”. / / By
                selecting “Shot Passed Only Act in Main Zone” option, only if the performance time of the relay in the
                shot point is located in the allowed range of the main zone the test “Passes”. For example, if this
                option is checked and a shot is
                added to tolerances of zone 2, the test “Passes” if the relay operates only in the time of zone 2 which
                is “95” ms to “150” ms; otherwise, with any other performances by the relay, the test “Fails”. But if
                this option is not checked, the
                allowed performance time of the relay is “95ms” to “No Trip” and if the relay does not give a trip in
                this point, the test “Passes”. “Test Passed Only Act in Zones” option is used for “Search”, “Check” and
                “Shot” tests. By checking this
                option, the test “Passes” when the relay performance in the tolerances, is only the time of one of the
                two zones. For example, if this option is checked and a shot is added to zone 1 and zone 2 tolerance
                area, if the relay operates in
                “28.5” to “80” ms or “95” to “150” ms the test “Passes”; otherwise the test “Fails”. This can also be
                done for “Check” and “Search” tests. / In “Trigger” tab you can specify the desired binary to receive
                the “Pickup” and “Trip” signals
                of the relay as well as stopping the current injection. The settings and explanation of this section are
                exactly the same as mentioned for “Trigger” room and “Sequencer”. In “Binary Output” tab, if it is
                necessary for the relay to view
                the conditions of the key, it is possible to take any needed voltage to the “Binary Input” through
                “Binary Output” of the device by voltages of “B” or “Aux Dc” groups. This tab has three modes of
                “Prefault”, “Fault” and “Post Fault” and
                it is possible to manage each of them separately. / /

            <Search>IMPEDANCE VIEW WINDOW As mentioned before, one of the main windows of Distance room is “Impedance
                View”. This window shows the relay characteristic curve based on the settings entered in “Test Object”
                window. This window has some shared and
                some unique features. The features available by right or left clicking on this window are common to all
                rooms and it is not necessary to explain them here but at the bottom of this window there is a gear by
                clicking on which some other
                useful options are displayed. By clicking on “Zoom During Test”, if one or multiple “Search” lines are
                drawn on the characteristic curve, by running the test you can see that the software zooms on the areas
                where the test points are located
                and shows the found zone line. / If you select “Optimize All” option, by changing the “Fault type”, the
                characteristic curve display is “Optimized”. By using “Pan Mode” you can move the characteristic curve
                diagram as desired. By using
                “Show row number” you can view the row number of any test point or test line on the characteristic
                curve. If you wish to see which “Zone” is the “Main Zone” of every point on the characteristic curve,
                you can check “Show Zone Number” option.
                By using “Show Zone number” the zone number of any test point or test line will be shown on the
                characteristic curve. By using “Show all zone”, test zones of all “Search” points are marked with a
                circle to find the characteristic curve
                line. By selecting “Show selected zone”, only the points of the line selected from “Search line” table
                are marked with a circle. / By clicking on “Show all t act point”, the operating time of the tested
                points is shown. Since maybe the
                points are close to each other and it is not possible to view the times clearly, you can use “Show
                selected t act point” option which shows the time of the row selected from the test points table. “Show
                all Z act Point” and “Show selected
                Z act Point” options are used to show all result of “Search Test” and the points related to the row
                selected from the “Search Test” table respectively. By selecting “Snap to grid” option, the points on
                the characteristic curve that are
                shot close to the grids snap to the grids of this page. By selecting “Snap to characteristic curve”
                option, the points on the characteristic curve that are “Shot” close to the characteristic curve grid
                snap to it. / About polygon or “Quad”
                zones tolerances it should be noted that the rounding of the tolerances occurs where the zone lines
                intersect. The reason for this is related to the definition of tolerance. Suppose a %5 tolerance; the
                tolerance is the geometric location
                of all points which have a %5 distance from the zone line. According to this definition, the tolerances
                turns into a semicircle where the zone line ends. In sections where the tolerances of a zone overlap,
                the union of tolerances are considered
                as the tolerances of zone. Therefore, based on the angle of the two intersecting sides of the zone, a
                part of the external tolerance zone turns into a curve. /

            <Search>“ZT DIAGRAM” AND “MEDIUM DETAIL VIEW” WINDOWS Test points and their characteristics in “Medium
                Detail View” To start first open “Medium Detail View” window from the toolbar and move it to an
                appropriate location. Characteristics of every point
                are displayed in “Medium Detail Window” with details. This window consists of two tables of “Shot data”
                and “Zone data”. In “Shot data” table, the information related to time, impedance, test point as well as
                current and voltage of the
                test point are shown. “Zone data” table is composed of two main parts. In the first part, general
                information related to relay zones along with the allowed operation time for each one is displayed and
                it is the same for all selected points.
                But the second part of this table changes according to the selected test point. / For example, if a
                point in zone 2 is selected, the general information of the zones will be displayed in “Zone Data” table
                without any change. But in “Is
                in Zone” column in the second table, it is specified that in which zones the selected point is located.
                In “Is in Tol” column it is specified whether the selected point is located in the tolerance zone or
                not. In “Zone Index” column, the
                main zone related to the selected test point is specified. If the point is located in only one zone,
                that zone will be considered as the main zone but it should be noted that if the point is located in
                multiple zones, the zone with the
                shortest nominal time will be considered as the main zone. / “ZT Diagram” window and points related to
                “Check Line” and “Search Line” To open “ZT Diagram” window, “View” menu or the toolbar should be used.
                On this window the time diagram
                based on impedance, according to the operation characteristic of the relay zones along a specific angle
                is displayed which the most important application of this in the software is finding the test points for
                “Search Test” and “Check Test”.
                Note that the diagram on this window is linked with “Impedance View” and any point that is “shot” on one
                of these two windows will be “shot” on the other window accordingly. In the curve of this window, the
                vertical lines are the border
                of zones and between the two vertical lines, the time-impedance characteristic of the zones in the angle
                specified by the user is displayed. On this window, tolerances are displayed with dotted lines and
                yellow zones. / Let us use an example
                to explain how this diagram works. If “Test View” is on “Shot Test”, and 0.5 ohm and 65 degrees are
                entered in “Z” and “Phi” fields in “ZT Diagram” window respectively, you can see that the point
                corresponding to this “Shot” is displayed
                on “Impedance View”. Note that in “Shot Test”, the values of “Angle” and “Phi” are the same because
                “Angle” refers to the angle of the line drawn from the point specified in “Origin”, with “X-R” diagram
                as its origin. By specifying it,
                the variation of time – impedance curve in “Angle” is displayed in “ZT Diagram” window. This means that
                if the “Angle” is 65 degrees, “ZT Diagram” shows the time variation based on the impedance in this
                angle. In this angle, the impedance
                moves from zone 1 with 30 ms to zone 2 with 100 ms and then moves from zone 2 up to “No Trip” zone. By
                moving on this diagram and clicking on its different sections, you can see the movement of “Magnet
                Cursor” in “Impedance View”. / To
                make it clear, if in “ZT Diagram” window, the “Angle” is changed to 40 degrees, you can see that the “ZT
                Diagram” changes because in 40 degrees angle, the impedance only changes from zone 1 to “No Trip”. In
                fact, by changing the angle,
                the “ZT” curve changes according to the zones available on its impedance course. In this diagram, you
                can see two blue dotted lines which the left side line indicate the “|Z|=0” line which is the minimum
                allowed impedance value. As you
                already know, impedance cannot be smaller than zero. The right side line indicates the selected point. /
                But in “Search Test” and “Check Test”, “Angle” is there angle of the drawn line “Phi” is the origin
                impedance angle of “Search Line”
                or “Check Line”, and values of them are different. For example, if in “Check Test” a “Check Line” is
                drawn from zone 1 to “No Trip”, you can see the time based on impedance diagram in “ZT Diagram” window
                in the angle where the line is
                drawn. In this diagram you can see two blue dotted lines where the first line indicates the start point
                and the second line indicates the end point of the “Check Line”. Note that in this state, the “|Z|=0”
                line is the start or origin point
                of the “Check Line” and the other blue line is the end point of the “Check Line” and the distance
                between these lines is the length of the “Check Line”. / An important point for understanding the
                concept of “Check Test” is that when a
                “Check Line” is drawn, the software starts moving on the line and adding a “Shot” on places where the
                tolerance is broken on the “ZT Diagram”. Here, as you can see, since there are three fractures along the
                “Check Line” in “ZT Diagram”,
                three “Shots” are added. In this case, the difference between “Search Test” and “Check Test” is that in
                “Search Test” the software does not add a “Shot” on all tolerance fractures on the “Search Line” but
                from the zone line towards both
                ends, it only adds a “Shot” to the first tolerance fracture. / Another point is that if you draw a
                “Search Line” or “Check Line” like this figure, you can see that in addition to adding “Shots” on places
                where the tolerance is fractured
                on the “ZT Diagram”, the software adds a “Shot” inside the zone and in the middle of the “ZT”
                characteristic accordingly. To explain this, if the line drawn from within a zone crosses a zone with
                different operation time but no point is
                “Shot” from that zone, the software adds a “Shot” to a point on “Search Line” or “Check Line” in the
                middle of its characteristic in “ZT Diagram” and “Impedance View”. /

            <Search>RELAY SETTINGS IN “DIFFERENTIAL” ROOM, PART 1 In “AMT Differential” room, differential relays and
                longitudinal differential “End to End” test is performed. Differential relays work by comparing the
                currents in both sides of the equipment and
                measure and compare the current in both sides of the protected equipment which is used to protect power
                transformers, motors, generators and busbars. Note that to perform this test, both Current group A and B
                are activated and if you intend
                to use Neutrik cable for the test, you need to select “Current” as “Combination Cable” in “Preferences”
                section in “Hardware” section. “Differential” room consists of two main windows of “Test View” and
                “Differential Characteristic”. In
                “Test View” window, “Shot”, “Check”, “Search” and “Stability” tests are performed. In “Differential
                Characteristic” window, the relay characteristic curve is displayed according to the information entered
                in “Test Object” based on “I bias”
                and “I diff”. // / As mentioned before, to test a relay, first it is necessary to enter its information
                in “Test Object” window. In “Device” block, information such as relay nominal characteristics, serial
                number, location of the relay
                as well as “CT” and “PT” characteristics of the relay are entered. This section has been thoroughly
                explained in previous videos. “Differential” is the main block of this room by double-clicking on which,
                “Differential Protection Parameters”
                window opens. This window consists of “Protected Object”, “Protection Device”, “Characteristic
                Definition” and “Harmonic” tabs where the settings of differential relay are entered. // “Protected
                Object” tab In “Protected Object” tab, the
                information related to the protected equipment is entered. In “Protected Object” field, first, the type
                of the protected equipment is selected among transformer, generator, motor and busbar and here
                transformer is selected. In “Vector
                Group” section, the transformer vector group which is entered in “Nominal Values” section is displayed.
                In “Number of Winding” section, the number of windings of the transformer is specified. If the
                transformer has three windings, a column
                named “Tertiary” appears in which the information of the third winding is entered. Here two-winding
                transformer is selected. In “Nominal Values” section the nominal information of the transformer is
                entered in “Primary”, “Secondary” and
                “Tertiary” columns for primary, secondary and tertiary sides, but since here the transformer has two
                windings, the “Tertiary” column is disabled. In “Winding/Leg Name” row, it is possible to enter an
                English or Persian custom title for
                the winding. In “Voltage”, “Power”, “Vector View” and “Connection Number” fields, the nominal voltage of
                the two sides of the transformer, the nominal power of the transformer equal in both sides, connection
                type of the two sides of the
                transformer and vector group number of the transformer are entered respectively. If there is a null
                point in the star direction of the transformer, select “Yes” in “Star Point Grounding” field. For
                example, if the transformer vector group
                is “YND11”, after specifying the transformer wiring type in “Vector Group” and its vector group number
                in “Connection Number”, in “Star Point Grounding” field “Yes” is selected in the primary column. In
                “Current” field, the nominal current
                of the both sides is calculated by the software based on the entered voltage and power which is not
                editable. In “Delta-Connected CT” field, if the “CTs” are wired in delta form “Yes” is selected
                otherwise “No” is selected. Then, in “CT
                Nominal Current” section, nominal information of the “CTs” in the both sides of the device are entered
                separately. Note that for this section the differential and bias current calculations are done according
                to the calculated current and
                the entered turns ratio but if from “View” menu, “Primary” is selected as “Unit”, primary currents of
                the both sides of the transformer in “Vector View” are displayed according to the “CT” turns ratio
                entered in “Device” block. In “Star
                Point Grounding” section the turns at which the null point of the “CTs” is located is specified. If the
                null point is located at the protection equipment Transformer side “tow.Pro.Obj” is selected otherwise
                “Toward Line” option is selected.
                “Protection Device” Tab After entering the characteristics of the protected equipment in “Protected
                Object” tab, it is necessary to enter the relay characteristics in “Protection Device” section. First,
                “lbias” formula is entered from
                “Ibias Calculation” field which consists of “seven” main formula. One of these formula should be
                selected form the relay manual and “Factor K1” is entered based on the selected formula. Generally, the
                characteristic curve is different
                for single-phase and multiple-phase faults but by checking “No Combined Characteristic” option, the
                differential characteristic curve will be the same in single-phase and multiple-phase faults mode. After
                drawing the characteristic curve,
                the complementary explanations are provided. / In “Reference Winding” field, the direction of the
                reference winding is determined which is selected in accordance with the relay settings. By selecting
                the reference winding direction, the
                angle in that end is considered to be 0. Since differential and bias currents are calculated and
                displayed based on the nominal current, it is necessary to select the nominal current of the relay among
                “CT” and nominal current of the protected
                equipment in “Reference Current”. For example, if “Current Protected Object Nominal” is selected for
                “Reference Current”, and “Idiff=2In”, “In” is the nominal current of the equipment whose information is
                displayed in “Protected Device”
                tab, “Nominal Values” section and “Current” field. But, if “CT Nominal Current” is selected, “In” is
                “CT” nominal current whose information is entered in “Protected Device” in “CT Nominal Values” section.
                In “Zero Sequence Elimination”,
                if the related relay supports zero sequence elimination in measurements, you can select the zero
                sequence elimination type in “Elimination Type” field. This feature has been put in relays so that if
                there is a phase to earth fault outside
                the protective zone, the existence of zero sequence current does not stop the relay. However, this makes
                the relay less sensitive to phase to earth fault. In “Test Time Setting/Transformer Model”, ”Test max”
                and ”Delay Time” fields specify
                maximum time of fault current injection and delay time after receiving ”Trip” contact, respectively. In
                ”Diff Current Setting”, ”Idiff” field is related to first stage and “Idiff” is related to second stage.
                Note that for currents lower
                than ”Idiff”, for Every bias current of the relay is stable and does not perform a trip. But currents
                bigger than “Idiff” indicate a fault near the transformer wiring and the relay performs an immediate
                trip without considering the bias
                current. But, between “Idff” and “Idiff” currents, the relay operation is based on the characteristic
                curve and there is no delay in the operation. In “Current Tolerances” you can enter the current
                tolerance in two forms of “Relative”
                and “Absolute”. Note that the software takes into account the highest value between these two. In “Diff
                Time Setting”, “Tdiff” field is the allowed operation time of the operation zone between “Idff” and
                “Idiff”, and “Tdiff” is the differential
                currents bigger than “Idiff”. In “Time Tolerances” you can enter the current tolerance in two forms of
                “Relative” and “Absolute”. Note that the software takes into account the highest value between these
                two.

            <Search>RELAY SETTINGS IN “DIFFERENTIAL” ROOM, PART 2 After entering the information in “Protected Object”
                and “Protection Device” tabs, it is necessary to enter relay differential characteristic curve in
                “Characteristic Definition” tab. In this tab
                it is possible to enter the characteristic curve in two ways. / 1- By clicking on “Draw Custom” option,
                “Draw Custom Characteristic” window opens where there are several “Template” of differential
                characteristic curve for different relays
                available. The relay type is specified in “Object” section. After selecting the relay type, the
                information needed to draw the differential characteristic curve is displayed in “Data” section in
                accordance with the relay settings. For
                example, by selecting “Siemens 7UTX” relay, the information needed to draw the differential
                characteristic curve is displayed. In “I” and “I”, “Slope1” and “Slope2”, and “Base point1” and “Base
                point2” fields, the minimum and maximum differential
                current specified in the relay, the slope of the first and second lines, and the crossing point of the
                first and second lines with “I bias” curve are entered respectively. To better understand the parameters
                of “Data” section, on the right
                side of this window the characteristic curve shape of each relay is sourced from its corresponding
                catalogue and the parameters are determined schematically. After entering this information, the
                differential characteristic curve of the
                intended relay is displayed in “Preview” section and in the box at the bottom, the start and end point
                information are mentioned according to “I bias” and “I diff”. Also, the slope of the line is displayed
                in “Slope” section. By clicking
                on “Draw” option, the settings are saved and the differential characteristic curve is drawn using the
                “Template” of the intended relay. / 2- The second method to enter the characteristic curve is using the
                features available in “Characteristic
                Definition” window and it is necessary to enter the information of every line of the characteristic
                curve separately. First, the information of “I” and “I” fields are entered. By entering the information
                of these two sections and closing
                the “Test Object” window, the differential characteristic curve is displayed in “Differential
                Characteristic” between the two entered numbers. After returning to “Characteristic Definition” tab in
                “Differential” block, first, all lines
                of the characteristic curve are removed by clicking on “Remove All” and then after entering the start
                point and end point coordinates of the first line of the relay curve in “New Start Point” and “New End
                Point” sections, “Add” option
                is selected. The slope of the line is calculated by the software in “Slope” field. Note that the slope
                of the differential line cannot be negative. Now the end point of the second line is entered and then
                “Add” option is selected so that
                the second line is added to the curve. Note that the end point of the second line is the same as the
                start point of the first line and this is why the “Start Point” section is disabled for the second line.
                By clicking on “Zoom All” option
                after entering the characteristic curve information, the curve is displayed completely in the box on the
                right side. In the box at the bottom of the page, the information of each section line of the
                characteristic curve is displayed separately.
                If you wish to remove a part of the characteristic curve, first, the part that you wish to remove is
                selected from the table and then “Cut from Here” option is selected. In the end by clicking on “OK”, the
                relay differential characteristic
                curve is displayed in “Differential Characteristic” window. By checking the “Show Final Search” option,
                if you have performed a “Search Test”, the result of the last “Search” will be displayed in the
                differential characteristic curve shape.
                For example, if you draw a line on the characteristic curve and perform a “Search Test”, and after
                clearing, return to “Characteristic Definition” and check the “Show Final Search” option, you can see
                that the result of the last “Search
                Test” is displayed in the form of a green “+” plus sign on the curve. By completing the “Differential
                Characteristic” tab, the “Harmonic” tab is completed as well. In this tab, the information related to
                harmonic characteristic of the
                relay for “Differential Harmonic” or “Inrush Blocking” test is entered. This test is performed in
                “Diff.Harmonics” room so all parameters of this section are thoroughly explained in “Diff.Harmonics”
                room. //

            <Search>INTRODUCING “TEST VIEW” WINDOW IN “DIFFERENTIAL” ROOM, PART 1 As mentioned previously, one of the
                windows in “Differential” room is “Test View”. This window consists of 7 tabs of “Shot Test”, “Check
                Test”, “Search Test”, “Stability”, “Setting”,
                “Trigger” and “Binary Output”. In “Shot Test” tab, you can select fault type and the points for the test
                and after the test is performed, you can view the results of the evaluation. In this tab, in “Test
                Point” section “Idiff” and “I bias”
                currents and in “Fault Type” section the fault type are determined. After specifying the test current,
                the fault type should be selected from among the standard faults available in “Fault Type” section.
                These faults include different faults
                of phase-to-earth, two-phase and three-phase. Before specifying the current and the fault type, you
                should determine “Supply Direction” in “Setting” section. // By clicking on “Add”, the selected test
                point is added to the table in this
                window. By selecting one of the rows and clicking on “Insert” option, the selected row is repeated in
                the table and by clicking on “Remove” option, the selected point is removed. Also, by selecting “Add to”
                option, it is possible to copy
                point or points selected for one of the “Fault Types” to another “Fault Type”. By clicking on “Remove
                All” option, all test points entered in the table will be removed. By clicking on “Sequence” option,
                “Sequence Test Points to” page opens
                where it is possible to specify test points with equal steps. In “Step” section and in “Step On” field,
                by selecting “Angle” it is possible to directly specify the angular steps in terms of angle. // This
                means that the test points are
                specified in accordance with the origin point and in “Origin” section, they are determined in a way that
                the required angles are resulted in proportion with the horizon. For example, if the start and end
                angles are “45” and “90” degrees
                respectively with “5” degrees steps and origin point for Idiff and I bias equal 5 times In, by approving
                this settings you can see that some points are added on the “Differential Characteristic”. For example,
                the last point is selected;
                by doing the mentioned calculation, in the picture you can see that the resulted angle is “85” and not
                “90” degrees which is because the “Origin” point is considered as one of the points and the last point
                of this “Sequence” is removed.
                / But by selecting “Direction”, an angle is specified in “Angle” field and in this angle from the
                “Origin” point, with the length entered in “Length” field and with the steps specified in “Step Size”,
                some points are shot on the characteristic
                curve. Note that the length and steps of the points are based on nominal current. For example, if the
                angle is “45” degrees and the length is “5” and the step is “0.5” times the nominal current and the
                origin point is “0” amp, by approving
                this settings you can see that some points are added to the characteristic curve at the angle of 45
                degrees with the origin of “0” volt and “0” amp. // If the performed test has “Failed” points, by
                selecting “Clear All Failed Tests” option,
                it is possible to clear all these points from the table of this section. In “Detail” section, the
                information related to “Trip” nominal time, the allowed operation time range, actual time and test point
                evaluation are entered in “t nom”,
                “t min” and “t max” fields, “t act” and “Stage” fields respectively. The test points are entered with
                detail in the table at the bottom of the page. The details include test evaluation, test current,
                nominal time, operation time, fault
                value in terms of percent and seconds and the minimum and maximum operation time. Also, if you wish to
                add a comment about any of the test points, you can use the “User Comment” cell. At the end of this
                page, it is possible to select test
                points table from different “Fault Types”. // After performing the “Shot Test”, “Check Test” and “Search
                Test” are performed. In “Check Test” the upper and lower tolerances of the relay, which are displayed as
                dotted lines in “Differential
                Characteristic”, are tested and evaluated. To perform the “Check Test”, first it is necessary to draw
                some lines named “Check Line” in different parts of the vector. To draw this line, first from “Origin”
                section in “Check Line” section,
                the start point of this line is specified. In “Idiff”, “I bias”, and “Angle” fields, 2In, 3In and -30
                degrees are entered as origin differential current, origin bias current and the angle of the check line
                respectively. Also, 1In is entered
                as the length of the check line in the cell of the “Length” section. Note that the drawn “Check Lines”
                must have at least one intersection with one of the characteristic curve tolerance lines. Then click on
                “Add” option to add the “Check
                Line” to the “Check Test” test lines table. / Another method for drawing the “Check Line” is to hold
                down left-click and “Ctrl” key on “Differential Characteristic” window and then move the cursor in the
                desired direction on the characteristic
                curve. You can see that the information of the drawn “Check Line” is displayed in “Check Test” lines
                table. After drawing the “Check Line”, the software evaluates the crossing place of “Check Line” and
                tolerance lines as “Shot” test in
                accordance with the performance of the relay. Here, after performing the test, the relay does not
                perform in lower tolerance and performs a trip in the upper tolerance so the result of the test is
                “Pass”. Other parts of this section such
                as “Fault Type” and “Remove All” and “Sequence” etc. options are the same at those of “Shot Test”
                section which have been explained in previous videos. The only additional option in this section is
                “Copy to Search”. By marking any of the
                test lines and selecting this option, it is possible to copy the selected line in “Search Test” and by
                selecting “Add” option in “Search Test”, add this line to the “Search Test” test lines table.

                “Shot Test” and “Check Test” in “Differential” room, it is necessary to perform “Search Test”. The
                purpose of this test is to find the characteristic
                curve line. To perform a “Search Test”, first some lines named search line should be drawn in different
                parts of the vector. The method for drawing these lines is the same as the one explained for check line.
                To draw this line, first the
                start point of this line is specified in “Search Line” section, “Origin” section. In “Idiff”, “I bias”
                and “Angle” fields, the origin differential current 2In, the origin bias current 3In and search line
                angle -30 degrees are entered respectively.
                The length of the check line 3In is entered in the cell of “Length” section. Then, click on “Add” option
                to add the check line to “Check Test” test lines table. // Another method for drawing the search line is
                to hold down left-click and
                “Ctrl” key on “Differential Characteristic” window and then move the cursor in the desired direction on
                the characteristic curve. You can see that the information of the drawn Search Line is displayed in
                “Search Test” lines table. After
                drawing the search line, the software evaluates the crossing place of search line and tolerance lines as
                “Shot” test in accordance with the performance of the relay. By performing the test, the software
                interpolates the characteristic
                curve by testing some points on the search line to find the exact location of the characteristic curve.
                “Ignore” field in “Search Interval” section is used when you wish to ignore the characteristic curve
                specified for the search line.
                By entering a number in this section, some points are added on the “Search” line with the entered number
                as their distance. For example, by entering 0.4 in this field, you can see that there are points added
                on the “Search Line” with as
                much as 0.4 of distance. If the test is performed, the points added on the “Search Test” are tested one
                after the other so that the exact location of the relay is specified. This option is used when there is
                no characteristic curve for
                the test or the current characteristics seem to be wrong. If you want to do this for all drawn test
                lines, you can use the “Setting” tab in “Ignore Nominal Characteristic” section. To do so, by entering
                the value of “Search Interval” and
                selecting “Apply to all” option, you can apply this settings to all test lines and find the relay
                characteristic. “Stability” Tab: “Stability” test is performed in this tab. In “Stability” test, for
                zero “I diff” differential current,
                for every “I bias” the relay must not perform a trip. If you hold down the “Ctrl” key and click on the
                characteristic curve, you can see that the shot points are located at the bottom of the characteristic
                curve and on the zero differential
                current line. In fact, in “Shot Test” you can select different bias currents by zero differential
                current and perform a stability test. The other explanations for this page are the same as those for
                “Shot Test” tab and you can watch the

            <Search>“DIFFERENTIAL” ROOM SETTINGS In this tab you can manage some of the settings related to performing
                the tests. In “Supply Direction” section, you can specify the injection and fault direction at the two
                sides of the protective device. By opening
                “Medium Detail View” window, you can see that on which side the fault point is located and by changing
                the “Supply Direction” type you can view that changes. Also, in this section it is possible to view the
                current amount, fault supplement
                direction etc. in “Fault Inception” section, the angle where the fault occurs is specified and the
                currents of the both sides are equally shifted. To better understand this, select “Signal View” from the
                toolbar and check “Voltage group
                A” from “Setting” and by changing the value of “Angle”, view the voltage and current signal changes. In
                differential test, if for any reason you wish to activate your voltages, you can use “Voltage Output”.
                // In “Time” section, first,
                the injection time before the fault is entered in “PreFault Time”. In “Max Fault Time” the maximum fault
                injection time is specified in two forms of “Abs” or “Rel” which consist of three parts themselves.
                About this time note that if in
                a “Shot” point the “Max Fault Time” is shorter than “Pick up” time, the result of the evaluation is
                wrong. If you are using the “Max Fault TimeAbs” field, you need to enter a time in terms of seconds for
                the maximum fault signal injection
                time for all of the points but to accelerate the test, you can use the “Max Fault TimeAbs” option. By
                checking this option, three other options appear. By entering a number in “Add %of Tnom”, the fault
                signal injection time in any point,
                equals the test point nominal time plus a percentage of the nominal time entered in this field. This
                means that if the test point nominal time is 10 seconds and 5 percent is entered in this field, the
                maximum fault injection time is 105
                percent of the test nominal time which is 10.5 seconds. But in “Add Absolute” field, the fault injection
                time equals the sum of the nominal time of the test point trip plus the time entered in this field. If
                all these three fields are
                filled, the software picks the longest time entered. For points that are located at the “No Trip” zone,
                it is possible to enter a separate time in “No-Trip Time” field. In “Post Fault Time”, the injection
                time after the fault is entered.
                “Delay after Trigger”, is used to enter the CB trigger time. By right-clicking on the related field and
                selecting “Go to Linked Value”, you can see that it is linked to “CB Trip Time” and if necessary, you
                can replace it with your desired
                value by selecting “Remove Link”. In “Time Reference”, by selecting “Fault Inception”, the “Trip” time
                is calculated from when the fault is injected. But by selecting “Starting”, the “Trip” is calculated
                from when the “Pickup” contact
                is received from the relay. In “Load Current PreFault Current” you can specify the settings for the
                phase and current related to “PreFault”. In “Amplitude” section, by selecting “Based on Current” radio
                button, the “PreFault” current is
                entered in terms of Ampere which is the same for all test points. But by selecting “Based on IFault”,
                the “PreFault” current is entered according to the fault current which is different for every “Shot”
                point. In “Search Setting” section,
                the settings related to “Search Test” are specified. As mentioned before, a “Search Test” arrives at a
                conclusion only if one of the three conditions of this section is met. The first condition is “Relative”
                which means that if the difference
                between the test point value and the previous point is less than the percentage specified in this field,
                this very point is the result of the test. The second condition is “Absolute” which means that if the
                difference between the test
                point and the previous point is less than the value specified in this field, this very point is the
                result of the test. The third condition is “Max point number” which means that the test is to be
                performed as many times as the number
                of points entered in this field at max and the last point is the result of the test. But if for any
                reason, the nominal characteristic determined for the relay is not available, you can use “Ignore
                Nominal Characteristic” section. By doing
                so, the software ignores the existing characteristic. Then, based on the step entered in “Search
                Interval”, it adds shots on the “Search” line. For example, a line is drawn in “Search Test” section.
                Then, 0.5 is entered as the value for
                “Search Interval” and “Apply to All” is selected. You can see that some points with the same step are
                added on the “Search” line. By running the test, you can see that the test starts from the lowest point
                and once one of the three mentioned
                conditions is met, the test arrives at a result. Also, if necessary, you can ignore this option by
                selecting “Disable all”. / By selecting “Shot Passed Only Act In Main Zone” in “Other Setting” section,
                the test is passed only if the relay
                performance time in the shot point is somewhere in the allowed range of the main zone. This means that
                if this option is checked and a shot is added in the tolerance zone of the bottom of the characteristic
                curve and the relay gives a
                trip, the test fails because after checking this option, the relay performance is accepted only if it is
                at the upper zone of the characteristic curve. “Search Passed Only Act in Zone” is for “Search Test” and
                by checking this option,
                the “Search Test” is passed only if the relay trip is in the “Tripping” zone of the nominal
                characteristic curve of the relay. In “Passed Setting” section, by checking “Pass if Get Any Trip”
                option, regardless of the relay performance
                time, if the relay operates in the “Tripping” zone, the test passes. In “Trigger” tab you can specify
                the desired binary to receive the “Pickup” and “Trip” signals of the relay as well as stopping the
                current injection. The settings and
                explanation of this section are exactly the same as mentioned for “Trigger” room and “Sequencer”. In
                “Binary Output” tab, if it is necessary for the relay to view the conditions of the circuit breaker, it
                is possible to take any needed
                voltage to the “Binary Input” through “Binary Output” of the device by voltages of “A”, “B” or “Aux Dc”
                groups. This tab has three modes "PreFault","Fault", "Post fault" and you can configure each section
                separately.

            <Search>“DIFFERENTIAL CHARACTERISTIC” WINDOW As mentioned before, one of the main windows of differential
                room is “Differential Characteristic”. This window shows the relay differential characteristic curve
                based on the settings entered in “Test Object”
                window. The top of the characteristic curve is called “Tripping” area while the bottom is called “Not
                trip” area. This means that if the test point is located at the top of the curve, the relay gives a trip
                otherwise it does not. This
                window has some shared and some unique features. The features available by right or left clicking on
                this window are common to all rooms and it is not necessary to explain them here but at the bottom of
                this window there is a gear by clicking
                on which some other useful options are displayed. By clicking on “Zoom during test”, if one or multiple
                “Search” lines are drawn on the characteristic curve, by running the test you can see that the software
                zooms on the areas where the
                test points are located and shows the found zone line. // / / If you select “Optimize All” option, by
                changing the “Fault type”, the characteristic curve display is “Optimized”. By using “Pan Mode” you can
                move the characteristic curve
                diagram as desired. By using “Show row number” you can view the row number of any test point or test
                line on the characteristic curve. By selecting “Show all zone”, test zones of all “Search” points are
                marked with a circle to find the
                characteristic curve line. By selecting “Show selected zone”, only the points of the line selected from
                “Search line” table are marked with a circle. By clicking on “Show all t act point”, the operating time
                of the tested points is showed.
                Since maybe the points are close to each other and it is not possible to view the times clearly, you can
                use “Show selected t act point” option which shows the time of the row selected from the test points
                table. “Show all Id & Ib Act”
                and “Show selected t act point” options are used to show all tested “Search Test” points and the points
                related to the row selected from the “Search Test” table respectively. By selecting “Snap to grid”
                option, the points on the characteristic
                curve that are shot close to the grids snap to the grids of this page. By selecting “Snap to
                characteristic curve” option, the points on the characteristic curve that are “Shot” close to the
                characteristic curve grid snap to it. / “Show
                Other Point” option: by selecting this option in single-phase faults such as “L1-E”, in addition to the
                shot points, another point is displayed on the “Differential characteristic” window in the form of a
                delta which in fact is the indicator
                of differential and bias current of the two other phases. This option is used in cases where the
                single-phase fault characteristic curve is different from the phase-to-phase fault. The reason for this
                difference is that in some areas,
                the relay does not perform a trip because of the differential and bias current of the phase being tested
                L1-E, but because of the differential and bias current of the two other phases. This means that if you
                have brought a general trip
                to the device to test single-phase fault such as “L1-E” and checked “NO COMBINED CHARACTERISSTIC”
                option, in some of the areas close to the characteristic curve the relay performs a trip for the “L1-E”
                fault but this trip is not the trip
                of the “L1” phase but it is related to current of the two other phases which can be also observed by
                using the characteristic of the delta point on the curve. If in same condition the “NO COMBINED
                CHARACTERISTIC” option is unchecked, you
                can see that this point is located at the “TRIPPING” zone.

            <Search>INTRODUCING “AMT DIFF. HARMONICS” ROOM “Differential Harmonic” test or “Inrush Blocking” test is
                performed in “AMT Diff. Harmonics” room. This room opens by clicking on “AMT Diff Harmonics” option. At
                the moment of initiation, power transformer
                draws a great deal of inrush current named “Inrush”. If the transformer is not completely
                “Demagnetized”, and has some residue, it makes it to draw a great deal of inrush current which can
                damage the transformer. One of the ways for detecting
                this inrush current at the moment of transformer initiation is to compare the secondary harmonic current
                with the main harmonic. / “AMT Diff Harmonics” room consists of two main windows of “Test View” and
                “Harmonic Restraint View”. “Shot”,
                “Check” and “Search” test are performed in “Test View” window and in “Harmonic Restraint View” the
                harmonic differential characteristic curve is displayed. This diagram is based on a percentage of the
                harmonic current of the “n”th level
                and “Idiff”. Note that in this window it is possible to manage the settings up to 20th harmonic and
                inject it into the relay. In this room, three current outputs of the device are used to perform the
                injection into the relay because the
                transformer turns via, three phases. / / Relay settings in “AMT Diff. Harmonics” Room As mentioned
                before, before testing the relay, its information must be entered in “Test Object” window. In “Device”
                block, information such as nominal
                characteristics of the relay, serial number, location of the relay and “CT” and “PT” characteristics of
                the relay are entered. This section has been thoroughly explained in previous videos. But the main block
                of this room is “Differential”
                by double-clicking on which “Differential Protection Parameters” window opens. This window consists of
                four tabs of “Protected Object”, “Protection Device”, “Characteristic Definition” and “Harmonic” where
                the differential relay settings
                is entered. / “Protected Object” Tab In this tab the information of the transformer on which the “Inrush
                Blocking” protection is done is entered. Frist, from “Protected Object” section, the “Transformer”
                option is selected. Other information
                of this tab such as the number of coils of the transformer, nominal voltage, nominal power, vector group
                characteristics and “CTs” characteristic should be entered at the two sides of the relay. This
                information is the same as that of
                the “AMT Differential” room and has been explained in previous videos. / “Protection Device” Tab After
                entering the transformer information, the information and differential relay characteristics are entered
                in “Protection Device” tab.
                This information includes determining the calculation formula of “I bias” or “I Restraint” current by
                the relay, determining the reference winding, specifying the maximum fault injection time and delay time
                after the “Trip”, entering the
                minimum and maximum differential current in the relay characteristic curve, entering the nominal relay
                operation time and specifying the current and time tolerances of the relay which are the same as “AMT
                Differential” room and have been
                thoroughly explained in previous videos. / “Characteristic Definition” Tab In this tab the information
                related to the differential characteristic curve is entered. This section is similar to “AMT
                Differential” room which has been thoroughly
                explained in previous videos. However, in this room, it is not necessary to enter the differential
                characteristic curve because in this room only the harmonic characteristic is displayed and “Inrush
                Blocking” test is performed. This information
                is mentioned here so that the “Xrio” file is correctly “Loaded”. / “Harmonic” Tab The information
                related to the harmonic differential characteristic curve of the relay is of entered in this tab. In
                “Harmonic” field, the harmonic level
                is specified and it is possible to specify the information second to 20th harmonic and inject it by the
                device. Note that, “n/a” in front of any harmonic level means that the settings related to that harmonic
                is not specified. In “Ixf/Idiff”
                field, which is disabled, the proportion of the “nth” harmonic to the differential current is displayed.
                In “Tol. Relative” and “Tol. Absolute” fields, the relay tolerances are entered in terms of a percentage
                of the nominal value or as
                “Abs” respectively and the software picks the highest tolerance amount as the reference. Next, the
                differential characteristic curve is entered based on the relay parameters. 20 percent and 45 percent
                are set on the level 2 and level 5
                harmonic current relays. First click on “Remove All” to remove all previous lines. Then, after entering
                the start point coordination in “New Start Point” section and then end point coordination in “New End
                Point” section in terms of “Idiff”
                and “Ixf/Idiff” click on “Add” to display the information of this line in the table at the bottom of the
                page and display the characteristic curve in the diagram at the right side. Note that it is also
                possible to edit the start and end
                points from the box at the bottom of the page. To enter the fifth harmonic information, select 5 in
                “Harmonic” field and enter the start point and end point coordinates in the table at the bottom of the
                page. Then click on “Ok” and close
                “Test Object”. You can see that the second harmonic differential characteristic curve is displayed by
                default. /

                and “Binary Output” where in addition to
                performing “Shot”, “Check” and “Search” tests, respectively, some other test settings are managed. /
                “Shot Test” Tab In this tab, first in “Harmonic Order” field in “Test Point” section, the harmonic level
                that you wish to test is entered.
                Meanwhile, you can see that its characteristic curve is displayed in “Harmonic Restraint View” window
                whose setting are entered in Test Object. Differential current and the proportion of the second harmonic
                current to the differential
                current are entered in terms of percentage in “Idiff” and “Ixf/Idiff” fields respectively. In “Angle
                Ixf/Idiff” field, it is possible to specify an angle for the harmonic current. In “Fault Type” section,
                the fault type is selected from
                among single-phase to earth and three-phase faults because the transformers are either single-phase or
                three-phase and only these modes are tested. In “Details” section, the nominal “Trip” time and the
                maximum and minimum allowed tolerances
                are displayed. After performing the test, the relay performance time is displayed in “t act” field. By
                selecting “Add” option, the information of this “Shot” is added to the “Shot Test” table along with its
                details. The details include
                test evaluation, differential and harmonic current, test angle, nominal time, performance time, fault

                in the table and by selecting “Remove option, the marked point is removed. By selecting “Add to” option,
                it is possible to copy the point or points selected from one of the “Fault Types” to another “Fault
                Type”. By selecting “Remove All”

                “Sequence Test Points to” page opens where it is possible to create test points with the same steps. By
                selecting “Angle” in “Step On” field
                in “Step” section, the angular steps are directly added in terms of degrees. / This means that the test
                points are specified in accordance with the origin point and in “Origin” section in a way that the
                required angles are resulted in
                proportion with the horizon. For example, if the start and end angles are “45” and “90” degrees
                respectively with “5” degrees steps and 0.3 and 2 origin points for Idiff and I bias with 0 angle, by
                approving this settings you can see that
                some points are added on the “Harmonic Restraint View”. For example, the last point is selected; by
                doing the mentioned calculation, in the picture you can see that the resulted angle is “85” and not “90”
                degrees which is because the “Origin”
                point is considered as one of the points and the last point of this “Sequence” is removed. / / But by
                selecting “Direction”, an angle is specified in “Angle” field and in this angle from the “Origin” point,
                with the length entered in “Length”
                field and with the steps specified in “Step Size”, some points are shot on the characteristic curve.
                Note that the length and steps of the points are based on nominal current. For example, if the angle is
                “45” degrees and the length is
                “2” and the step is “0.1” times the nominal current and the origin point current and the second harmonic
                are “0”, by approving this settings you can see that some points are added to the characteristic curve
                at the angle of 45 degrees
                with the origin of “0”. After removing all of the points by using “Remove All” option and adding three
                new “Shots” to the table, the test runs and the relay performance is analyzed. If the performed test has
                “Failed” points, by selecting
                “Clear All Failed Tests” option, the results of these points are “Cleared” from the table and you can
                test the point again by right-clicking on its row and selecting “Apply Test”. / “Check Test” Tab After
                performing the “Shot Test”, “Check
                Test” and “Search Test” are performed. In “Check Test” the upper and lower tolerances of the relay,
                which are displayed as dotted lines in “Harmonic Restraint View”, are tested and evaluated. To perform
                the “Check Test”, first it is necessary
                to draw some lines named “Check Line” in different parts of the vector. To draw this line, first from
                “Origin” section in “Check Line” section, the start point of this line is specified. In “Idiff”,
                “Ixf/Idiff”, “Angle Ixf/Idiff” and “Angle”
                fields, 1In, 17 percent, 0 degree and 0 degree are entered as origin differential current, the
                proportion of the “nth” harmonic current to the differential current, the angle of the “nth” harmonic
                current and the angle of the “Check Line”
                respectively. Also, 5In is entered as the length of the check line in the cell of the “Length” section.
                In “Harmonic Order” field, the harmonic level is selected so that its curve is displayed. Note that the
                drawn “Check Lines” must have
                at least one intersection with one of the characteristic curve tolerance lines. Then click on “Add”
                option to add the “Check Line” to the “Check Test” line table. / / Another method for drawing the “Check
                Line” is to hold down left-click
                and “Ctrl” key on “Harmonic Restraint View” window and then move the cursor in the desired direction on
                the characteristic curve. You can see that the information of the drawn “Check Line” is displayed in
                “Check Test” lines table. After
                drawing the “Check Line”, the software evaluates the crossing place of “Check Line” and tolerance lines
                as “Shot” test in accordance with the performance of the relay. Here, after performing the test, the
                relay does not perform in lower
                tolerance and performs a trip in the upper tolerance so the result of the test is “Pass”. Other parts of
                this section such as “Fault Type” and “Remove All” and “Sequence” etc. options are the same at those of
                “Shot Test” section which
                have been explained in previous videos. The only additional option in this section is “Copy to Search”.
                By marking any of the test lines and selecting this option, it is possible to copy the selected line in
                “Search Test” and by selecting
                “Add” option in “Search Test”, add this line to the “Search Test” test lines table. “Search Test” Tab
                After performing “Shot Test” and “Check Test” in “AMT Diff. Harmonics” room, it is necessary to perform
                “Search Test”. The purpose of
                this test is to find the characteristic curve line. To perform a “Search Test”, first some lines named
                “Search Line” should be drawn in different parts of the vector. The method for drawing these lines is
                the same as the one explained
                for “Check Line”. To draw this line, first the start point of this line is specified in “Search Line”
                section, “Origin” section. For example, in “Idiff”, “Ixf/Idiff”, “Angle Ixf/Idiff” and “Angle” fields,
                1In, 17 percent, 0 degree and
                0 degree are entered as origin differential current, the proportion of the “nth” harmonic current to the
                differential current, the angle of the “nth” harmonic current and the angle of the “Search Line”
                respectively. Also, 6In is entered
                as the length of the check line in the cell of the “Length” section. In “Harmonic Order” field, the
                harmonic level is selected so that its curve is displayed. Then click on “Add” option to add the “Search
                Line” to the “Search Test” test
                lines table. After drawing the “Search Line”, the software tests the intersection location of the
                “Search Line” and tolerance lines as “Shot” and evaluates them based on the relay performance. Upon
                running the test, by testing some points
                on the search line the software starts interpolating the characteristic curve and determines its exact
                location. / “Ignore” field in “Search Interval” section is used when you want the intended “Search” line
                to ignore the specified characteristic
                curve. By entering a number in this section, some points are added on the “Search” line with this number
                as the distance between them. For example, by specifying “2In” in this field, you can see that some
                points are added on the “Search
                Line” with “2In” distance from each other. By clicking on “Add” option, this “Search Line” is added to
                the “Search Test” lines table. If the test runs, the points added on the “Search Test” are tested one
                after the other until the exact
                location of the relay characteristic curve is determined. This option is used when there is no
                characteristic to test or the characteristic that you have seems wrong. If you wish to do the same for
                all of the tested lines, you can use
                “Setting” tab in “Ignore Nominal Characteristic” section. To do this, by entering the value in “Search
                Interval” and selecting “Apply to All” option, you can apply this setting to all test lines and find the
                relay characteristic. /

        <contant id="Setting_tab">
            <Search>“SETTING” TAB In this tab it is possible to manage some settings related to running the tests. In
                “Supply Direction” section, it is possible to determine the direction of injection and fault at the two
                sides of the protective device for the
                test. To better understand this, open “Vector View”; here you can see that if
                “Fault_Primary_Supply_Secondary” is selected, three primary currents of the transformer are displayed in
                “Vector View while by selecting “Fault_Secondary_Supply_Primary”,
                three secondary currents of the transformer are displayed. Note that for “Inrush Blocking” test, three
                primary currents need to be injected. / In “Fault Inception” section, the angle where the fault occurs
                is specified that this angle
                shiftes currents of the both sides equally. To better understand this, select “Signal View” from the
                toolbar and check “Voltage group A” from “Setting” and by changing the value of “Angle”, view the
                voltage and current signal changes.
                If for any reason you wish to enable the voltages, you can do so by checking “Enable Voltage Output”
                from “Voltage Output” section and then you can enter the value of the voltage in the intended field. In
                “Coefficient for Fault” section
                it is possible to specify a coefficient for fault current values. “For Single Phase Factor” and “For
                three Phase Factor” fields are the fault current coefficients for single-phase and three-phase faults.
                By changing the fault current coefficient,
                it is possible to view the changes in “Vector View”. / In “Time” section, first, the injection time
                before the fault is entered in “PreFault Time”. In “Max Fault Time” the maximum fault injection time is
                specified in two forms of “Abs”
                or “Rel” which consist of three parts themselves. About this time note that if in a “Shot” point the
                “Max Fault Time” is shorter than “Pick up” time, the result of the evaluation will be wrong. If you are
                using the “Max Fault Time Abs”
                field, you need to enter a time in terms of seconds for the maximum fault signal injection time for all
                of the points but to accelerate the test, you can use the “Max Fault Time Rel” option. By checking this
                option, three other options
                appear. By entering a number in “Add %of Tnom”, the fault signal injection time in any point, equals the
                test point nominal time plus a percentage of the nominal time entered in this field. This means that if
                the test point nominal time
                is 10 seconds and 5 percent is entered in this field, the maximum fault injection time is 105 percent of
                the test nominal time which is 10.5 seconds. But in “Add Absolute” field, the fault injection time
                equals the sum of the nominal time
                of the test point trip plus the time entered in this field. If all these three fields are filled, the
                software picks the longest time entered. For points that are located at the “No Trip” zone, it is
                possible to enter a separate time in
                “No-Trip Time” field. In "Post Fault time" the injection time is entered in the post-error mode. The
                "Delay After Trigger" field is used to calculate the key operation time. We can access it by
                right-clicking on the relevant field and
                selecting "Go To Linked Value“. There is a link to "CB Trip Time". Then, you can select "Remove Link"
                and enter the value you want instead. In "Time Reference" by selecting "Fault Inception", the "Trip"
                time is calculated from the time
                the error was injected. However, by selecting "Starting", the "Trip" time is calculated from the time
                the "Pick-up" contact is received from the relay. In the "Load Current Prefault Current" section you can
                make the phase and current settings
                related to "Prefault". In the "Amplitude" section the current range in "Prefault" mode is entered
                according to the coefficient of the rated current and in the "Phase" section, the current angle is set
                to "Prefault" mode. / In “Search Setting”
                section, related to “Search Test” are specified. As mentioned before, a “Search Test” arrives at a
                conclusion only if one of the three conditions of this section is met. The first condition is “Relative”
                which means that if the difference
                between the test point value and the previous point is less than the percentage specified in this field,
                this very point is the result of the test. The second condition is “Absolute” which means that if the
                difference between the test
                point and the previous point is less than the value specified in this field, this very point is the
                result of the test. The third condition is “Max point number” which means that the test is to be
                performed as many times as the number
                of points entered in this field at maximum and the last point is the result of the test. But if for any
                reason, the relay nominal characteristic is not available, you can use “Ignore Nominal Characteristic”
                section. By doing so, the software
                ignores the existing characteristic. Then, based on the step entered in “Search Interval”, it adds shots
                on the “Search” line. For example, a line is drawn in “Search Test” section. Then, 0.5 is entered as the
                value for “Search Interval”
                and “Apply to all” is selected. You can see that some points with the same step are added on the
                “Search” line. By running the test, you can see that the test starts from the lowest point and once one
                of the three mentioned conditions
                is met, the test arrives at a result. Also, if necessary, you can ignore this option by selecting
                “Disable all”. / By selecting “Shot Passed Only Act In Main Zone” in “Other Setting” section, the test
                is passed only if the relay performance
                time in the shot point is somewhere in the allowed range of the main zone. This means that if this
                option is checked and a shot is added in the tolerance zone of the bottom of the characteristic curve
                and the relay does not give a trip,
                the test passes but if the relay gives a “Trip” the test fails. If the “Shot Passed Only Act In Main
                Zone” option is not checked, the performance time is between “20” milliseconds and “No Trip” and if the
                relay gives a “Trip” this point
                passes. By selecting the "Test Passed Only Act In Main Zone" option, the "Shot", "Check" and "Search"
                tests will "Pass", only after the relay operation time is defined only in the allowed range; for example
                if the relay operation rated
                time is "0" to "30" milliseconds and between the operating zone and "No Trip" a point in the tolerance
                zone is selected, if „Test Passed Only Act In Main“ option is checked, that time test will „pass“ which
                relay function is set in one
                of each ranges. Therefore, If the relay time is, for example, "40" milliseconds, the test result will be
                "Fail". If this option is not checked, the test result will be "Pass". In the "Passed Setting" section,
                by checking "Pass If You Get
                Any Trip", regardless of the time of operation of the relay, if the relay works in the "Tripping" area,
                the test will "Pass" test. In “Trigger” tab you can specify the desired binary to receive the “Pick up”
                and “Trip” signals of the relay
                as well as stopping the current injection. The settings and explanation of this section are exactly the
                same as mentioned for “Trigger” room and “Sequencer”. In “Binary Output” tab, if it is necessary for the
                relay to view the conditions
                of the circuit breaker, it is possible to take any needed voltage to the “Binary Input” through “Binary
                Output” of the device by voltages of “A”, “B” or “Aux Dc” groups. This tab has three modes of
                “Prefault”, “Fault” and “Post Fault”
                and it is possible to manage each of them separately. / /

            <Search>“HARMONIC RESTRAINT VIEW” WINDOW As mentioned before, one of the main windows of diff Harmonics room
                is “Harmonic Restraint View”. This window shows the relay harmonic characteristic curve based on the
                settings entered in “Test Object” window.
                The top of the characteristic curve is called “Tripping” area while the bottom is called “No trip” area.
                This means that if the test point is located at the top of the curve, the relay gives a trip otherwise
                it does not. This window has
                some shared and some unique features. The feature available by right or left clicking on this window are
                common to all rooms and it is not necessary to explain them here but at the bottom of this window there
                is a gear by clicking on which
                some other useful options are displayed. By clicking on “Zoom during test”, if one or multiple “Shot” or
                “Search” lines are drawn on the characteristic curve, by running the test you can see that the software
                zooms on the areas where the
                test points are located and shows the found zone line. / / If you select “Optimize AllChange Fault Type”
                option, by changing the “Fault type”, the characteristic curve display is “Optimized”. By using “Pan
                Modealt+mouse+click” you can

                On “Start” page, the “AMT Transducer & Meter” room software is opened. This room is comprised of the two
                main windows of “Test View” and “Transducer
                Characteristic”; in “Test View” window, it is possible to perform a “Shot Test” for various quantities
                and compare the results with the meter characteristic. / / To begin the test, after completing the
                information in “Device” in “General
                Test Object” window, double click on “Transducer” option. On “Transducer Properties” page, it is
                possible to view a set of functions. To test the meter, two functions of “Wh” and “Varh” are used; here,
                “Wh” is selected. By selecting “Injection”
                option in “Input” section, it is possible to perform the “Offload” test of the meter by injection from
                the device. The other option is “Read from Binary” which is used to perform an “On Load” test of the
                meter. By selecting this option,
                it is necessary to enter the values into the inputs of the device using the clamps and interface cables.
                / / / In “Output” section, it is possible to specify the type of the output received from the meter. To
                test transducers and their
                corresponding outputs, by selecting “Current” or “Voltage” options, it is possible to take the output
                current and voltage values to the inputs 9 and 10 for measurement. To test the meter, if only the output
                values are being displayed on
                the screen, “Open Loop” option can be used. Here, “Pulse” option is used so that using the light sensor
                which comes with the device, the number of the output pulses of the meter is recorded. / / In „CT Star
                point Connection“ section, the
                connection related to the current transformers are specified. Usually and since the active power flows
                from the busbar toward the line, "Toward Line” option is selected. Selecting “Toward Line” is in
                accordance with the injection of the
                active power from the device to the equipment. If “Toward Busbar” is selected, 180 degrees are added to
                the angle of the current. / In “Full Scale Error Reference” section it is possible to specify the error
                recording reference which can
                be selected from a range of zero to the maximum or negative to the positive maximum. If the
                characteristic is asymmetrical the range is from zero to the maximum while if the characteristic is
                symmetrical, it is possible to select both
                options for error measurement. As for error measurement, suppose that for a transducer with a
                characteristic with the maximum input of 1 amp and output of 33 milliamperes, for a 0/5 amp current, the
                output of the transducer equals 16 milliamperes.
                In such a case, the error percentage is calculated as follows. / / This means that ideally, for a 480
                milliamperes input, the output equals 16 milliamperes. Therefore, the absolute error value equals 20
                milliamperes and the error percentage
                equals -4 percent: / Also, the “Full-Scale” error value of the transducer equals -2 percent. / This
                method is used for cases where “Full Scale Error Reference” is set at “0…+max”. If the characteristic is
                “Symmetrical”, the error calculation
                method should be selected from among “0..+max” and “-max…+max”. For the previous example, if the
                characteristic was symmetrical and “-max..+max” was selected, the following relation is used for “Full
                Scale Error” calculation. / In "Tolerance”
                section, it is possible to enter the error value as an absolute or a relative value; the default values
                are 1 milli pulse and 0/25 percent. Finally, a comparison is made between these two values and the
                larger value is selected as the
                allowed error value. In “Number of phases” section, it is possible to specify whether the meter is
                single-phase or three-phase. / / The test characteristic is specified in "Characteristic Definition”
                section. Since the meter characteristic
                is linear, “Linear” option is selected as the “Characteristic Type” and it is uneditable. / To specify
                the energy “Import” and “Export” values, it is possible to check the “Symmetrical” option so that there
                is a Symmetrical characteristic
                in both sides available. The “Minimum Value”, “Knee Point” and “Saturation range” fields are disabled
                for meter test but in “Maximum Value” section, it is possible to enter the amount of power and the
                number of pulses received in exchange
                for that amount of power. Usually, the meter factor or “c/r” is entered in this section. For example,
                the factor for a edmi mk6e meter equals 5000 Wh per pulse. / / Note that by using “Primary” and
                “Secondary” options at the top of the
                screen, it is possible to enter the values as primary or secondary in accordance with the meter type
                which needs to be done considering the CT and PT conversion ratios. / "Relative” and “Absolute” options
                are used for displaying the absolute
                or relative amount of the values. After entering the values, “Ok” is selected to continue with the test.
                After completing the information in "Transducer Properties” section, the “Hardware Configuration”
                settings need to be examined. By
                opening this window, you can see that the current and voltage outputs are set by default. / In
                "Binary/Analog Input” tab, you see that the Binary number 8 is selected to record the pulses of the
                meter by default. However, it is possible
                for the user to use any other binary if necessary. By clicking on “Ok”, the applied changes are saved. /
                To perform a test, a point on the characteristic must be selected which can be done using two methods:
                1- Entering the values in the
                fields of “Test Point” section which means entering the related parameters including Wh value, number of
                pulses, test performance time and frequency. Then, by selecting “Add”, this point is added to the test
                table. / 2- Holding down the
                “CTRL” key and then clicking on the meter characteristic curve. / / On “Test View” page, by clicking on
                “Advanced View”, a page opens where it is possible to enter the voltage, current and their angle as well
                as the cos ∅ to be injected
                by the device. Moreover, in “Waveform” section it is possible to add phase shift and DC offset to the
                harmonic specified signals. After specifying these values, apparent, active and reactive powers are
                separately calculated for every phase
                and displayed in the box at the bottom of this section; if necessary it is possible to make changes from
                this section as well. / / / After adding the intended points, the test can be started and after the time
                specified in accordance with
                the pulses and Wh elapsed, the results are displayed. In performing this test, some points must be
                considered: 1- If a test point is specified in Wh mode, zero is entered as the value for reactive power
                by default and to change this, first
                the current angle needs to be changed from “Angle” field. / / 2- The time entered in “Time” field by the
                user changes in accordance with the characteristic curve of the meter. This change is in a way that the
                number of pulses changes to
                integer. / 3- Being “Out of Range” for the points in this test depends on the required time for
                performing the test. Since the maximum injection time of the device is 4000 seconds, if a test point
                needs more time for the test, that point
                becomes “Out of Range”; to change the state of this point, more voltage or current can be entered in
                “Advanced View” section. / 4- If a too large value is entered in “Wh” field, this value is recorded as
                “na” and by selecting “Add”, this
                point becomes “Out of Range”. /

            <Search>“OFFLOAD” TEST OF THE METER PART 2 In addition to the tests that the user can perform by specifying
                different points on the energy meter characteristic, in the offload section, 5 other tests available in
                this section are as follows: -Load
                Test -Mechanism Test -Injection Test -No-Load Test -Creep Test As mentioned in the first part, before
                performing any of the tests, we enter the information about the energy meter in the Test Object section.
                First, enter the CT and PT conversion
                ratio data, and then, in the Transducer Properties section, enter the meter constant. After confirming
                the entered information, select the test from the Test Mode to be performed and after adding the points,
                run the test. Load Test In
                this section, the voltage injection and current for a specific time is set to evaluate the number of
                pulses. Finally, the overall energy performance of the meter can be checked. The purpose of this test is
                to evaluate the error rate for
                measuring different elements in the meter. To execute the test, first go to the Advanced View section,
                here we need to adjust the active power in the supported range of energy meter. Then, we add three
                points with 5, 10, 15 pulses to run
                the test, and we run the test. As you can see in the Test Point section, information about watt-hour,
                pulses, test duration and time and its frequency can be set. Mechanism Test In this section, the
                injection of rated current and rated
                voltage is done for a certain period of time to evaluate the amount of transmission energy. The purpose
                of this test, in addition to evaluating the error rate in the overall measurement, is to evaluate the
                error rate of the device in measuring
                various elements. Since the number of pulses is not important, points can be entered for testing based
                on watt-hour and time elements. The evaluation conditions of this test are based on the use of the Open
                Loop feature so that at the
                end of the test, the user can enter the measured value manually. Injection test In this test, voltage
                and current are continuously injected to ensure the accuracy of the wiring as well as the initial
                function of the meter. Adjustable elements
                in the Test Point section for this test are: watt-hour, pulses, test duration and time, and frequency.
                To perform the test, add a dot and run the test. No-Load Test The focus of this test is injecting 150%
                of the rated voltage and zero
                current; to check the performance or non-performance of the meter. The relationship between the minimum
                test duration is specified as follows: / In this test, to achieve 150% of the rated voltage, the voltage
                limit should be changed from
                the Test Object section, if necessary. Then, the test should be performed by setting the voltage to 150%
                of the rated voltage. As you can see, there is no current injection in this section. Creep Test
                Injecting 0.5% of the rated current
                with the rated voltage is performed in this section to check the performance or non-performance of the
                meter. In this section, you can also add points to perform the test based on the amount of watt-hour,
                pulse or duration. After each
                test, you can view the results in the Report window by selecting the Report View option.

            <Search>“ONLOAD” TEST OF THE METER An introduction to Edmi Mk63 meter About “Edmi Mk63” that is the piece of
                equipment that we are going to test, this should be noted that this meter is basically an energy meter
                that measures varh, Wh and Vah basic
                values. Also, it is possible to measure a wide range of values instantaneously. In the picture of the
                cover of this meter depicted below, terminal blocks for measuring the current and voltage as well as the
                connectors for the pulse input
                and output optionally can be seen. / / Possible diagrams for meter terminals / The position of “Config”
                jumper in “MK6E” meter is displayed in this picture. This jumper is located on the right edge near the
                “Select” button. This jumper
                has two states of “Config” and “Secure”. To change the settings, the plastic jumper is taken out and
                placed on another set of pins. Connecting the upper and center pins puts the jumper in the “Secure”
                state while connecting the lower and
                center pins puts it in the “Config” state. / All current meters have “CT” to “VT” links between “TB1”
                terminals and ends number 1,2,4,5,8,9,12 and 13. Also, there is a static link between 12 and 14. To
                perform some tests, it is necessary
                for these links to be removed. / Position of CT to VT links / Power supply, voltage and current wiring
                in 3-wire and 4-wire structures The voltage nominal input differs in accordance with the type of the
                meter. Also, the current range
                is in accordance with the meter current range and should be limited to “Imax”. In 4-wire mode, the
                maximum line-to-neutral and the maximum line-to-line voltages are 290 and 500 volts, respectively. In
                3-wire mode, the maximum line-to-line
                voltage equals 290 volts. In higher voltages, the meter cannot function appropriately and might get
                damaged. “TB1-1” and “TB1-11” are the two inputs considered for the side power supply voltage. “TB1-11”
                needs to be considered as the negative
                input in DC systems and as neutral in AC systems. The voltage input of the side power supply equals 110
                VAC/VDC plus-minus 20 percent. Generally, it is possible to consider the following four combinations for
                the power supply: • Type I
                – VT power supply: used for most metering applications, especially in Low Voltage sites where when all
                the VTs are disconnected, the meter turns off. • Type II – LCD 24 volts side power supply with the local
                power supply: used in cases
                where it is necessary to read the meter even if the main power supply is not available. In such cases, a
                24-volt battery power supply will be used to read the meter.• Type III – side power supply: for
                switchyard uses where the meter needs
                to be always on and there is enough space for the side power supply of the system. If for any reason,
                this side power supply is disconnected, the meter turns off. • VT Priority – along with the High Voltage
                auxiliary power supply with
                200 to 240 volts range: in this state, naturally, the meter receives the necessary power from the VT
                circuits. When all of the VTs are disconnected, the changeover board activates and auxiliary terminals
                are used. • VT Priority – along
                with the Low Voltage auxiliary power supply with 57 to 120 volts range: in this state, naturally, the
                meter receives the necessary power from the VT circuits. When all of the VTs are disconnected, the
                changeover board activates and auxiliary
                terminals are used.This structure is most useful in cases where the VT burden is not problematic but the
                power supply is always available for protective systems. Default display screen / "The structure of the
                digits and symbols displayed
                on the screen from the top left are as follows: The two first characters of the first row of the screen
                stand for the direction of the var and var, respectively. “+” sign refers to positive energy / output /
                delivered and “-“ sign refers
                to negative energy / input / received. If the slot for these characters is empty, it means that the
                amount of energy equals zero. The third character that resembles a beating heart indicates that the
                meter is active and the display screen
                is up to date. The fourth, fifth, and sixth characters show the active rate for W, var and VA values,
                respectively, in form of numbers from 1 to 8. The seventh character indicates the state of the battery
                and means that that the battery
                is empty or unrecognized when turning on. If the Daylight Saving feature that refers to the daylight
                saving time is active, the letter D is displayed as the eighth character. The current time is displayed
                on the right side of the screen.
                The initial three characters at the bottom of the screen show the alarm status. The fifth, sixth and
                seventh characters at the bottom of the screen show the login state. L means login through the optical
                port Local, M means through the
                modem port and S means login through SCAD port. In the end, we can see the current date on the right
                side of the bottom. / Power direction graph In the above figure: Refers to voltage impedance angle in
                relation to the current and equals
                current admittance angle in relation to the voltage. Pulse outputs:The pulse outputs are capable of
                doing more than only showing the power usage. MK6E has a maximum number of 6 outputs that are directly
                located inside the meter. At the
                bottom of the LCD, there are two LEDs located on the meter that are used to assess the pulses produced
                in the accuracy test. These LEDs are connected to outputs number 1 and 2. The state of these LEDs is
                directly reflected on the TB3 outputs.
                The picture below indicates the state of EDMI MK6E terminals. In fact, TB5, TB4, TB3 and TB6 are the
                terminals in which the outputs are located. All of the outputs are voltageless contacts. These outputs
                are completely isolated from the
                other circuits and in some cases, have common terminals. BOSFET drivers are set at 110 nominal volts. /
                / / An important point is that for Active and Inactive times, the exact time is one percent shorter than
                the specified value. This
                amount will be even shorter if the system frequency is more than the nominal value. Therefore, the
                output will be lower as much as the same amount. Under normal conditions, these factors will not have
                any noticeable effect on the length
                of the pulse. It should be noted that this will only change the pulse time duration and the minimum
                off-time of the LED but not the rate of the pulse. If during inactive times, the rate of the pulse is
                zero or less than zero, the output
                will remain active. If the rate of the pulse decreases, the pulses will be recognizable one more time.
                If this time is too short, the pulses will not be backed up and will merge into one another. Therefore,
                to avoid missing the pulses
                in high load conditions, selecting the appropriate parameter is of great importance. Using the LED
                output to test the accuracy of the delivered Wh is a necessity. A 0.01 Wh/p pulse rate will be needed in
                the meter terminals. The light
                pulse must be 90ms long with a minimum interval of 50ms between the pulses so that the sensor can
                appropriately recognize the current process. The settings and combinations required for the test are as
                follows: No Inversion, 90ms active
                time, 50ms inactive time, parameter 0.01, All channels, W, Export + It should be noted that the EziView
                software has a built-in calculator for connecting to this meter that can help the user in adjusting the
                parameters for the pulse output.
                This tool can be used by clicking on the calculator when configuring the output in form of Pulsing. This
                calculator enables the user to specify the system characteristic line-to-line voltage or line-to-neutral
                voltage, current and the
                amount of load and determine the pulse output rate. / Using the pulse outputs for the test: The easiest
                way to test the accuracy of the meter is to use the LED pulse or output pulse. This test is similar to
                performing a test for meters
                with spinning disc. Pulse outputs are configured using the EzView software. To achieve the best results,
                the pulse rate must never exceed 10 pulses per second. Also, the test must be at least 10 seconds long.
                Testing the meter and the
                software settings: To test “Energy Meters” or meters in online mode or under load, “AMR Transducer &
                Meter” room can be used. As mentioned before, this room is composed of “Test View” and “Transducer
                Characteristic” main windows. Since
                the function of each of these options has been explained before, repeating them does not seem necessary.
                To begin the test, the user needs to double click on “Transducer” option after completing the
                information in “Device”, in “General
                Test Object” window. There is a set of “Functions” available on “Transducer Properties” page. To test a
                meter, two functions of “Wh watt-hour” and “Varh var-hour” can be used and here “Wh” is selected. To
                perform an “Onload” test, the
                user needs to select the “Read from Binary” option in “Input” section. By selecting this option, the
                values are entered into the “Inputs” of the device using the clamps and interface cables. The output
                type of the meter can be specified
                in the “Output” section. To test the meter, if only the output values of the meter are being displayed
                on the screen, the “Open Loop” option can be used. Here the “Pulse” option is used so that by using the
                light sensor that comes with
                the device, the number of output pulses of the device is recorded. The connection related to the current
                transformers needs to be specified in “CT Star point connection” section. Since normally the active
                power flows from the busbar toward
                the line, “Toward Line” option is selected. In “Tolerance” section, it is possible to enter the fault
                value in two forms of absolute and relative and the default values are 1 millipulse and 0/25 percent.
                Also, in „Number of phases“ section,
                it is possible to select from among single-phase or three-phase in accordance with the meter type. The
                test characteristic is specified in „Characteristic Definition“ section. Since the meter characterisic
                is linear, the „Characteristic
                Type“ is set at „Linear“ and cannot be changed. “Saturation Range”, “Knee Point” and “Minimum Value”
                fields are deactivated for the meter test but in “Maximum Value” section, it is possible to specify the
                amount of power and the number
                of pulses received in return. Usually, the meter factor or “c/r” value is entered in this section. For
                example, the factor for an edmi mk6e meter equals 5000 watt-hour per pulse. After completing the
                informatioin in „Transducer Properties“
                section, the settings in „Hardware Configuration“ need to be examined. By opening this window, the user
                can see that the current and voltage outputs are configured by default. Also, in „Binary/Analog Input“
                tab, the user can see that binary
                number 8 is selected to record the meter pulses by default. However, it is possible to use a custom
                „Binary“ of the device as well. " The only difference between onload and offload tests of the meter is
                that the inputs need to be prepared
                to record the values measured using the measurement equipment clamps. To do this, the user only needs to
                click on “Test Hardware Configuration” option in the “Binary Input Calibration” section and assign the
                available binaries to record
                the values of current and voltage in accordance with the meter characteristic or that it is either
                single-phase or three-phase. By default, binaries number 2, 1, and 3 are assigned to record the voltage
                while binaries number 5, 6, and
                7 are assigned to record the current values measuring using the clamp. Using the “Sum”, “Mul”, and “Deg”
                parameters, it is possible to edit the measured values in different conditions in accordance with the
                measurement equipment being
                used. For example, if a clamp shows 1 volt in the output in return for 10 amps, by measuring a 15 amps
                current, our binary will receive 1.5 volt. Therefore, by entering factor “10” in “Mul” section, this
                value can be edited. As another
                example, if our clamp has a 0.5 degree phase measurement error, this item can be edited through “Deg”
                section. In “Sum” section it is possible to perform a “DC” shift that is not of use in this test. By
                selecting the option in “Analog
                Output” section in “Test Hardware Configuration” window and entering the values of current and voltage,
                it is possible to calibrate the binary inputs. To perform the test, the user only needs to specify the
                inputs of the intended binary
                and then, begin the process of measuring the elements of current and voltage to compare with the meter
                characteristic. It should be noted that in “Online Values” section, the power, voltage, current and
                other elements related to the meter
                are displayed and updated instantly.

            <Search>TRANSDUCER TEST To perform a transducer test, AMT Transducer & Meter room can be used. This room
                consists of two main windows of “Test View” and “Transducer Characteristic”. In this section, it is
                possible to test single-phase and three-phase
                transducers with symmetric performance characteristics such as active and reactive power characteristics
                or asymmetrical ones. To begin the test, the user needs to double-click on „Transducer“ option after
                completeing the data in „Device“
                section in „General Test Object“ window. On “Transducer Properties” page, it is possible to view a set
                of “Functions”. For a transducer test, the user can select from among functions such as active power,
                reactive power, apparent power,
                frequency, current, voltage, power factor, load factor, phase in degrees, mean current, DC current, DC
                voltage, DC power and line to line voltage. Some of these parameters can be measured in single-phase
                state, some in three-phase state
                while some can be measured in both states. In accordance with the transducer type and its manufacturer
                company, this equipment can have different inputs and even in some cases, several inputs simultaneously.
                Finally, these inputs will
                be converted into analog signals. On the other side, the transducers can also have binary outputs which
                are activated as soon as the specified characteristic goes past a certain limit. In some other cases, it
                is possible to use the output
                binary signals as a counter that produces a pulse based on the measured energy. The type of output
                received from the transducer is specified in “Output” section. To test transducers and in accordance
                with their output, it is possible to
                take their output current and DC voltage to the inputs of the device for measurement by selecting
                “Current” or “Voltage” option. Otherwise, “Pulse” option can be selected so that the number of pulses
                are recorded. “Open Loop” option makes
                it possible to record the values in transducers that only display the output on the screen that is
                located in front of the user. So a window asking the user to enter the values manually appears. The
                connection related to the current transformers
                is specified in “CT Starpoint Connection” section. since normally active power flows from the busbar
                toward the line, “Toward Line” option is selected. Selecting “Toward Line” is in accordance with the
                injection of active power from the
                device into the equipment. If “Toward Busbar” is selected, 180 degrees are added to the current angle. /
                Connection of a sample transducer to CT and PT In “Full scale error reference” section, it is possible
                to specify the reference for
                recording the error which is specified as a range from zero to maximum or from negative to positive
                maximum. If the characteristic is asymmetrical, the range is from zero to maximum and if it is
                symmetric, both options can be selected
                for error calculation. Before this, in the video related to offload test of the meter a complete
                explanation about error calculation has been provided. In “Tolerance” section, the error value can be
                entered in form of an absolute or a
                relative value and the default values are 1 millipulse and 0/25 percent. In the end, a comparison is
                made between these two values and the greater value is selected as the allowed error value. About
                transducers, before anything, the accuracy
                class for different characteristics of power, current, voltage to frequency must be specified. This
                factor is obtained using the calculations and relations that are available in the manual of the
                transducer. In „Number of phases“ section,
                it is specified whether the transducer is single-phase or three-phase. The test characteristic is
                specified in „Characteristic Definition“ section. Since the transducer characteristic can be either
                linear or non-linear, symmetric and asymmetric
                options are available for „Characteristic Type“. Moreover, it is possible to select the appropriate
                option in accordance with the features of the transducer from „Linear“, „Compound“, and „Quadratic“. To
                specify energy “Import” and “Export”
                values, “Symmetrical” option can be checked so that a different characteristic from both sides is
                available. The minimum value for the input and output of the transducer is specified in “Minimum Value”
                field. If the compound performance
                characteristic option is selected, Knee Point needs to be specified as well. In fact, this point divides
                the characteristic into two parts with different ranges. The maximum value for the input and output of
                the transducer is specified
                in “Maximum Value” field. Also, the range of the performance characteristic is specified in “Saturation
                Range” field. It should be noted that by using „Primary“ and „Secondary“ options at the top of the page,
                it is possible to enter the
                values in form of primary or secondary in accordance with the type of the meter which should be done
                considering the CT and PT turns ratio. „Relative“ and „Absolute“ options are used to display the
                relative or absolute value of the elements.
                After entering the values, „OK“ is selected to continue with the test. "After completing the information
                in “Transducer Properties” section, “Hardware Configuration” needs to be examined. By opening this
                window, the user can see that the
                current and voltage outputs are adjusted by default. Also, in “Binary/Analog Input” tab it can be seen
                that binary #9 is considered for measuring the output milliampere by default. However, if necessary, it
                is possible to use any other
                binaries of the device. After applying the changes, by clicking on “Ok”, the changes are saved. To
                perform the test, the user only needs to specify the intended binary inputs and then begin the process
                of measuring the voltage and current
                elements in order to compare them with the transducer characteristic. Here we are going to perform the
                sample test on a transducer. The transducer is of the S3-WRD series which is a sample for
                reactive/active power measurement or watt/var.
                This transducer has a 0.2 percent accuracy for the output rate. The S3-WRD series is available in three
                different models of S3-WRD-1, S3-WRD-3 and S3-WRD-3A. Their difference is in how they are used in
                single-phase and three-phase systems
                as well as three-wire and four-wire systems.. Also, it is possible to use these transducers with 1 and 5
                amps input currents as well as a vast variety of voltage inputs. The model we are analyzing is S3-WRD-3
                and a picture of its wiring
                can be seen in the following. / For example, for a 230 watt var output, this transducer gives a 4
                milliampere output with 1 amp of input current and 132 volts of input voltage. If the output power is
                zero we will have 12 milliamperes and
                if it is 230 watts, we will have 20 milliamperes in the output. Considering these values and the linear
                characteristic of the transducer, it is time to test this equipment. In the first step, by running the
                AMPro software, we enter the
                AMT Transducer & Meter environment. Before anything, by clicking on “Test Object Parameters”, the
                information related to the transducer is entered in “Device” section. This information includes the
                title/explanation for the transducer,
                the manufacturer company, type of the device, installation location of the equipment and the serial
                number. In “Nominal Values” section, values related to CT secondary and PT are entered in accordance
                with how the test is performed. Now,
                after accepting these items, by double-clicking on “Transducer”, the user enters the “Transducer
                Properties” window. By selecting the intended function which here is active power, the output is set at
                Current. By enabling the “Symmetrical”
                option, it is made possible to also evaluate the negative values. In “Minimum Value” section, 230 watts
                is entered as the input value and its corresponding output which equals 4 milliamperes is entered. In
                “Maximum Value” section, 230
                watts is entered in secondary form as the value and the corresponding current for this output is
                specified to be 20 milliamperes. After accepting these, it is time to add the points on the
                characteristic and perform the test. A simple
                approach is to click on “Sequence” and specify the upper and lower limits of power and the number of
                test points so that the points are added in certain distances. By performing the test, it can be
                observed that the output values are recorded
                in accordance with the applied input. By enabling the display of Actual Value for binary #9, it is
                possible to view the waveform of the measured values in “Signal View” window in the software.After the
                test is finished, the intended elements
                are selected and the report is prepared.

        <contant id="An_Introduction_to_AMT_SYNCHRONIZER">
            <Search>AN INTRODUCTION TO AMT SYNCHRONIZER To test synchronizer relays, “AMT-Synchronizer” room can be
                used. The synchronizer is a piece of equipment that is used to connect the generator to the grid that is
                being used and uses the voltage of both
                sides to examine the state of frequency and voltage and if the difference between the generator voltage
                range and frequency, and the grid is less than the specified limit, the connect command is issued. If
                the mentioned difference is more
                than the specified limit, the relay will not issue the command for the connection. In this case, the
                relay examines the generator frequency and voltage state compared to the grid. If any of these two
                parameters is lower or higher than
                the specified limit, the relay synchs the two systems by giving the command for an increase or decrease
                in the “AVR” and the governor. The synchronizer room has several pages and exclusive windows. The two
                main windows of this room are
                “Test View” and “Synchronizer Characteristic”. The “Shot Test” and “Synchronizer” tests are done in the
                “Test View” window. To perform a “Shot test” in this room, like the other rooms, the user only needs to
                specify a test point and perform
                the test. Also, the performance of the relay in synchronizing the two systems is tested in the
                “Synchronizer” tab. The synchronizer characteristic is displayed in the “Synchronizer Characteristic” in
                accordance with the information entered
                in the “Test Object” of this room. The tools available by right-clicking or left-clicking in this window
                and the cog at the bottom are common in all rooms. To enter the relay information for the test, the
                first thing is to enter the nominal
                information of the relay in “Device”. In this section, it is necessary to enter characteristics such as
                “PT” turns ratio and frequency. In the next step, the relay characteristics are entered after
                double-clicking on “Synchronizer”. Since
                these relays use voltage, in “Protection Device” tab, it is necessary to select the sequence of phases
                and the phases that are connected to the relay in “Rotation sense” and “Connected Voltages” for systems
                1 and 2. Note that system number
                one is an infinite bus and system number two is a generator that needs to be connected to the grid. An
                important point is that when the system phases are wired as ACB, it is necessary to select L1-L3-L2
                radiobutton. Also, if “Connected
                Voltage” on any of the phase-to-ground states is selected, the voltages of systems one and two are
                displayed in “Test View” in form of phase-to-ground. The key performance time is entered in the
                “Setting” section of this part and in the
                “CB Closing time” field and the phase shift that can come from intermediate equipment or a coupling
                transformer is specified in the “Transformer Group Phase Shift”. The nominal voltage of the system
                number two is entered in “VNom L-LSecondary”
                field and if this value is different from that of system number one, it needs to be specified. By
                specifying this value, the voltage difference that is resulted from the test will be in relation to
                nominal voltage of system number two
                and not the voltage of system number one. This means that if the nominal voltage of system number one is
                110 volts and the nominal voltage of system number two is 100 volts and the allowed difference of these
                systems is specified to be
                2 volts, the minimum and maximum voltage of system number two must be 98 and 102 volts, respectively.
                When the PT secondary turns ratio of the grid and the generator are the same, “Use Ratio of System 1” is
                to be used. For example, if
                the PT turns ratio of the grid is 400KV/110V and the turns ratio of the generator is 15.75KV/100V, since
                the secondary turns ratio of the two systems is not the same, the user needs to enter the PT secondary
                voltage of the generator or
                system number two in the “VNom L-LSecondary” field. The characteristic related to the relay is entered
                in “Synchronizing Window”. The characteristic entered in this section needs to be in accordance with the
                relay settings. The upper and
                lower limits of voltage difference and the upper and lower limits of frequency difference are entered in
                deltaV, deltaV, “deltaF” and “deltaF” fields, respectively. The relays mostly tend to issue a connect
                command in the “Dead Zone” range
                that is located between “deltaFmin” and “deltaFmax” parameters. The allowed angle difference of the
                system number 2 is entered in “deltaPhi” Nom field and is entered in delta Phi. For example, if the
                nominal angle of system number 2 is
                30 degrees and the allowed difference is 20 degrees, by going to Vector View window, the user can see
                that the allowed connection range is determined to be between 10 to 50 degrees. Also, the allowed
                tolerances for different parameters
                and the minimum allowed connection time are entered in the fields on the right side. About the voltage
                that is being used for the test, it should be noted that the relays measure the applied voltage and if
                the nominal voltage is as much
                as 110 or 100, the user only needs to apply “VL1-E” and “VL2-E” for systems number 1 and 2 with the same
                value to the relay and this can be viewed in the “Hardware Configuration”. For example, if in the
                “Protection Device” in the “Connected
                Configuration” tab the two systems are set at “L1-L2” mode, by going to the “Hardware Configuration”
                window and in the “Analog Output” section, it can be seen that considering the selected mode, two
                sources are specified for the voltage
                that is being used for the test and that in fact, VL1_E plays the same role as “VL1-L2” of system number
                one and “VL2-E” plays the same role as “VL1-L2” of system number two. To better understand this, suppose
                that a 110 volts line-to-line
                voltage is used for system number 1 and for system number two, a 63.5 volts “VL1-E” phase voltage is
                used. To enter the information of such a system, it is necessary to enter “L1-L2” and “L1-E” as the
                Connected Voltage for systems number
                one and two, respectively. Also, 63.5*√ 3 or 110 volts is entered as the “Vnom L-L” for system number
                two. Now, by opening the “Test View” and “Vector View” pages, it can be seen that 63.5 and 110 volts are
                entered as the nominal voltage
                for systems number two and one, respectively. The next point is that only for system number one it is
                possible to select a three-phase voltage because only the Voltage groupA of the device is three-phase
                and as for system number two it
                is only possible to select a single-phase or line-to-line voltage.

        <contant id="Test_View_Window_in_Synchronizer_Room">
            <Search>TEST VIEW WINDOW IN SYNCHRONIZER ROOM “Shot test” is the first test that can be performed on
                “Synchronizer”. To perform this test, first you need to enter the system 1 characteristics which is a
                simulator of the infinite bus and the system
                2 characteristics which is a simulator of the generator. The amount of voltage difference, frequency and
                angle of systems 1 and 2 are entered in “DeltaVL-L”, “delta F” and “delta Phi” respectively. The amounts
                of voltage, frequency and
                angle are specified in the column at the right side of this box. Note that it is possible to directly
                specify the voltage, frequency and phase values of the system 2 in which case the amount of difference
                between the specified values with
                their nominal values is displayed in the column on the left side of this box. In performing this test,
                the characteristics of system 1 is fixed and for every test point, the characteristics of system 2
                change. Other methods to add test
                points include clicking on the characteristic curve and selecting “Add” or holding the ctrl key and
                clicking on the intended point on the characteristic curve. Finally, after specifying the test point,
                the test is performed and in accordance
                with that whether the test point is inside the characteristic or outside it, the relay issues connect or
                disconnect command. The test point assessment is done in accordance with synchrony or non-synchrony of
                “Nom” and “Act” columns in
                “Assessment” section in the test point table. The characteristics of system 2 / the test point is
                specified in “System2” section. Other options of this section are the same as those of the other
                previously mentioned rooms. As an example,
                a point inside the connection zone and another point outside this zone are selected. By performing the
                test you will see that the relay gives a close command inside the zone and does not connect outside this
                zone. The second and the most
                important performable test is “Synchronizer”. To perform this test you need 5 outputs from the relay. In
                fact, this relay has 5 main outputs and by giving the raiser or lower command for voltage and frequency,
                the act of “Synchronizing”
                and connecting the unit to the network is done. These outputs, which should be connected to the device
                for the test, include “V”, “VM”, “F”, “F” which are used to raise voltage, lower voltage, raise
                frequency and lower frequency respectively.
                In “Trigger” tab in “Binary Setting” section, the settings of related “Inputs” can be specified. In this
                section, to receive the commands such as receive voltage raise command, receive voltage lower command,
                receive frequency raise command
                and receive frequency lower command, “B1:V”, “B2:V”, “B3:F” and “B3:F” are used respectively. Also
                “Close Command” is used to receive the close command from the relay. In performing this test, the inputs
                are simulators of governor and
                “AVR” which are commanded by the relay. This test in this tab is done in the way that when you select a
                test point and run the test, the relay enters the voltage and frequency of system 2 to the closing zone
                by giving the voltage and frequency
                change commands and finally, gives the close command. About performing this test it should be noted that
                it is necessary to enter “Generator Model” in accordance with the system characteristics because the
                changes in voltage and frequency
                are done in accordance with the pulses sent from the relay and the settings entered in this section. For
                example, if “0.1” is entered as “delta V/delta t”, if one one-second pulse is sent from the relay to
                decrease the voltage, the voltage
                decreases by 100 millivolts. But if a 500-milliseconds pulse is sent, the voltage decreases by
                500millivolts. As an example, here a test point is selected and “1v/s” and “100mHz/s” are entered as
                “delta V/delta t” and “delta F/delta t”
                respectively. By running the test you can see that based on the signals received by the inputs from the
                relay, the characteristic enters the connection zone from the outside. As the final point, it is
                necessary to know that the time of
                each of the tests is specified in “Fault Time” section in “Setting” which, if necessary, can be changed.

                front of you. As you can see, by loading the template, a variety set of tests for different functions
                will be in front of you. In the
                Nodes section, you'll see available subcategories to test each function. In the Summary column, a
                summary of the test status and whether it is successful or unsuccessful will be displayed. The three
                options of Inheriet Xrio, Inherit Hardware
                Config and Inherit Report Settings by being active, respectively, will make the user's chosen function
                inherit all settings from Xrio, hardware settings and report settings. However, by disabling them, you
                can apply the settings to each
                one and manually as you wish. The Open UI option will also allow you to manage the opening of the
                related window to each test. If you select Advanced View from the above section, more elements such as
                test window status, reporting status,
                test progress rate, and more will be observed. In the Root subset, the Xrio file is located first. By
                selecting this option and clicking the Open option, you can upload the Xrio received from the relay,
                which actually fits the active functions
                set. You can access the details by clicking on any other option and selecting Open. For example, by
                clicking HardwareConfigFile you can view and edit the default hardware configuration for current and
                voltage injection, as well as inputs
                and outputs of the test device. The Start Note option, which is located before testing each function,
                also provides the user with explanations to guide the test further. In this section you can enter the
                information that test man guide
                during the test. For example, you can place a note in the overcurrent protection function that indicates
                the overcurrent protection in your relay is an emergency type and can only be activated by blocking
                distance protection and can be
                tested. In the top part of the page, you can add or remove tests by clicking Add Item or Remove. For
                example, here we remove Switch Onto Fault, Recloser and VTS tests due to the inactivity of these
                functions in our relay as well as the
                shortening of the testing process. In addition, you can make it possible to change settings or points by
                disabling Inheriet Xrio. For example, for overcurrent protection, we applied settings manually and
                placed different points on the
                characteristic curve than those designed in accordance with XRIO. In the first stage of testing, Wiring
                Test is designed to check the current and voltage values injected from the device on the relay to ensure
                the correct wiring. Electrical
                Test is another option that, with three state including PreFault, Fault and PostFault, checks the relay
                conditions in different situations and ensures registering the trip when a fault occurs. As mentioned
                above, a set of tests for different
                functions is designed in the default template but it is possible to remove, add and manage the tests
                accurately for the user. In this way, you can determine the priority of performing different tests,
                disable some tests, and even more
                precisely, specify which tests to do with what values and in what range. You can check how the test is
                designed by clicking on each test and selecting Open. For example, you can view or edit points on the
                characteristic by selecting Zone
                Reaches for the Distance function. By running the test, you can check different functions. Finally, by
                right-clicking on the VccReportView window, you can have a complete management of the items that are
                going to be displayed in the report.
                For example, here we will perform the Micom P444 relay test in AMT VCC room. In the Configuration
                section, you can see the active or inactive status of the functions. In the subset group 1 of settings,
                you can also see details about each
                function's settings and values. In the PSL relay section, we also configured the inputs, outputs and
                leds for different functions. Now it's time to save the XRIO settings file. In the next step, we
                re-enter the AMT VCC room and first load
                the template related to the P444 relay. Now we prepare different function tests using the XRIO file that
                we took from the relay in the previous step. By running the test, you can control the test of different
                functions step by step.

            <Search>INTRODUCING “CURRENT TRANSFORMER CT” ROOM One of the instrument which can be tested by “AMT105” is
                current transformer or “CT”. “CTs” are very useful for converting the high current of an electrical
                system to a current measurable by relays
                and measurement devices. Generally, there are two types of “CTs” including “Measuring” and “Protection”.
                The difference between these two types is in their ratio accuracy or accuracy class as well as
                saturation level. Since “Measuring”
                “CT”s are used in measurement devices, when there is a fault, if the current entered this equipment
                increases too much, the equipment might be damaged. But “Protection” “CTs” are used in relays and since
                the performance of a relay is in
                accordance with the amount of fault current, these “CTs” should be able to move the fault current of the
                network to the secondary with the least possible error. In drawing the equivalent circuit of this
                transformer, the “CT” turns ratio
                is “1:N”. “Rp” and “Xp” equal the “CT” transformed to the secondary while “Xs” and “Rs” indicate the
                resistance and “CT” secondary leakage flux. In parallel branch, “Re” and “Rh” are indicators of losses
                of eddy current and the hysteresis
                respectively and “L” indicates the magnetization inductance or “CT” secondary self-inductance. In the
                equivalent “CT” circuit, unlike normal transformers, the parallel branch is located in the secondary
                side and this very branch is the
                reason for core saturation in high currents. Since the primary resistance and leakage flux in “CT” is
                insignificant, “RP”, “XP” and “Xs” can be ignored. By clicking on “Current Transformer CT” on the start
                page of the software, the “CT”
                test room opens. In tests performable by the “AMT 105”, RCT, saturation curve and the turn’s ratio are
                achieved with two methods of voltage or current. Moreover, measurement test of the burden connected to
                the “CT” secondary is performable
                by this device as well. “Test Object” and “Megger” tabs are used to enter the nominal information of
                “CT” and the results of “Megger” test respectively. / “Test Object” Tab: Any module to be able to
                perform a test needs some information
                about the equipment. This information is entered in “Test Object” section. The general information about
                “CT” which should be recorded in the report is entered in “General Information” section. The company’s
                title, the country, name and
                the address of the substation and installation place of “CT”, title of the manufacturer of “CT”, “Type”
                of “CT”, serial number of “CT”, title of the feeder on which “CT” is installed, phase number, “IEC”
                standard number written on the
                plaque of “CT”, number of cores of “CT”, number of taps of “CT” and additional information are entered
                in “Company”, “CT Serial Number”, “Feeder/Bay”, “Phase”, “IEC-ID”, “Core Number”, Tap” and “Additional
                Information” fields respectively
                to be added to the report. In “Extra Data” section, the test date in A.D., the information of the
                performer of the test and the information of the supervisor are entered in “Date”, “Tested By” and
                “Approved By” fields respectively. / By
                checking “Easy Mode” option in “Accessories” section, the wiring of the tests changes. This wiring is
                based on the board designed by Vebko Company for the “CT” test. The mentioned board is located on the
                front panel of the device and there
                are some relays placed on it which automatically manage the wirings of the front panel of the device
                which makes performing the test easier. The main information of the “CT” which has influence on the
                calculations of knee point and evaluation
                of the tests are entered in “Test Setting” section. The CT core type is selected from among “Measuring”
                and “Protection” in “Core Type” field. The accuracy class of the “CT” is specified in “Class” field. If
                the type of “CT” is “Measuring”,
                the accuracy classes available in drop-down field such as “0.5s” mean that in 100 to 120 percent of the
                nominal current crossing the primary “CT”, there may be measurement fault up to this percentage max. If
                the “CT” is “Protection” there
                are different accuracy classes one of which is selected according to the “CT” type and the information
                required for every “CT” is displayed in “Nominal Values” section. / For example, if “10P or 10Pr” is
                selected as accuracy class, based
                on “ALF” in “CT”, there may be up to 10 percent error in “ALF” times the primary nominal current. This
                means that if the “ALF” for a “CT” with an accuracy class of “10P” is “20”, in 20 times of the nominal
                current in the “CT” primary,
                if the nominal “Burden” is connected to its secondary, there may be up to 10 percent measurement
                deviation. In “Applied Standard” field, the standard used for the “CT” is determined. In “Class
                Multiplier” field, a factor is entered between
                “0.2” and “1” to be multiplied by accuracy class. This factor makes the “CT” accuracy class harder in
                turns ratio test. This means that if the “CT” accuracy class equals “10P” and its accuracy factor equals
                “0.8”, the maximum “CT” error
                in “ALF” times the primary nominal current is 8 percent. / In “Nominal Values” section, the nominal
                values are entered according to the type and class of the “CT”. Primary current, secondary current,
                nominal frequency, apparent power and
                secondary resistance in the temperature specified on its plaque usually 75 degrees are entered in their
                related fields. “Fs” or “Security Factor” indicates the measuring “CT” security factor and is defined as
                the ratio of instrument limit
                primary current to the rated primary current. Note that the actual “Fs” value is dependent on the burden
                of the “CT”. If the burden connected to the “CT” is lower than its nominal burden, the “Fs” value is
                increased and the “CT” is saturated
                in higher current. For example, when the “Fs” of a “CT” is “5”, this “CT” is saturated in 5 times the
                nominal current. / “ALF” or “Accuracy Limit Factor” is defined as the proportion of accuracy limit of
                the primary current to the nominal
                current. The value of actual “ALF” is dependent to the burden connected to the protective “CT” secondary
                and its value decreases as the value of the connected “Burden” increases. “CT” Power factor, apparent
                power of the actual burden connected
                to the “CT” and the ambient temperature which equals 25C are entered in “Cos phi”, “Actual Burden” and
                “Ambient Temperature” fields respectively. If the “CT” accuracy level is “X or PX”, “PXR”, “TPX”, “TPY”
                and “TPZ”, options such as “Exciting
                Current Ie”, “Kssc”, “Rb”, etc. are added to “Nominal Values” section which should be entered from the
                “CT” plaque. This information is used to estimate the knee point for excitation test. To view how these
                parameters work you can go to
                “Excitation Test” tab and by holding the “Mouse” pointer on the estimated knee voltage, view its
                relation. / / In “Winding Material” field in “Temperature Correction” section, the material used in the
                coils is selected from among “Copper”
                and “Aluminum”. In “Winding Temp” field, the current temperature of the “CT” coil is entered. Also, in
                “Reference Temp.” field, the reference temperature is entered to measure the resistance value of the
                coils so it can be used to correct
                the values measured in different temperatures. Normally, the reference temperature is written on the
                “CT” plaque in front of the secondary coil resistance which usually equals 75 degrees. In “Correction
                Factor” field, the temperature correction
                factor is calculated in accordance with the ambient temperature, reference temperature as well as the
                material of the coil which is not editable. In some cases, in the “Test Sheet” which comes with the
                “CT”, the coil resistance is measured
                in a temperature other than the one mentioned on the plaque. If you wish to enter the value of this
                resistance, by checking “R Man.Ref.Temp.” option, you can enter the resistance. In this case, this
                resistance and its temperature are considered
                as the reference and are added to the results table in the “R Man.Ref.Temp.” column in “Resistance Test”
                tab that the temperature which is measured by the manufacturer is based on the resistance and is
                measured and showed in this test.
                / The number entered in “RMS Accuracy” box in “Number of Period” field, shows the number of cycles used
                for calculation. By default, this number is set at “1”. As the number of cycle’s increases, the software
                uses more cycles in “AC” mode
                and more time in “DC” mode for calculations. By doing so, the number of calculations increases and the
                software speed is decreased but the result of the test will be more precise. / By clicking “Add to
                Report” option at the bottom of the
                page, this information is added to the report and then a message saying “The Report was added to the
                list” is displayed. By selecting “Report” window from the right side strip, it is possible to view the
                report. By clicking on “Delete
                Report”, the report added from “Report” window is removed from “Delete from Report” window. If “Set as
                default” option is selected, the entered information is saved and set as default and by opening “Current
                Transformer CT” room, this
                information is displayed. For the instructional videos of this section, a 10P10 protective CT with 500/1
                as turns ratio, 50 Hz as frequency and 15 VA as Burden is going to be tested. /

            <Search>“SECONDARY BURDEN” TEST In this test, the “Burden” connected to the secondary “CT” is measured. In
                this test, by injecting the AC” current, and measuring “AC” voltage by using the “Binary/Analog Input”
                and dividing voltage by current, the
                value of “Z” and impedance angle and consequently “R” and “X” of the secondary route are achieved. To
                perform this test, the time and current of the test are entered in “State setting” section, in “I test”
                and “State Time” fields respectively.
                The specified current limitation for this field is “32” amps but a “5” amps current for “5”amp “CTs” and
                a maximum “1” amp current for “1”amp “CTs” would be enough. After entering the “State Setting”
                information, the wiring should be done
                in accordance with the illustration shown. Note that by double-clicking on the picture you can maximize
                it. To perform this test, first, you need to disconnect the “CT” from all parts that connect the current
                to measurement equipment.
                In this wiring, you should short circuit “Ia1” and “Ib1” current output phases and connect “Ia2” and
                “Ib2” phases to the route through which the “CT” current is transferred. / / / / / / / Also, to measure
                the “AC” voltage, you should connect
                the “Binary/Analog input”1 to the test route and further than the current injection connectors. Note
                that before performing the test it is necessary to press “Init Test” so that the device is configured
                automatically. By clicking on this
                option, the current and time settings of the test as well as the hardware settings related to “Hardware
                Configuration” including the device outputs and “Binary/Analog Inputs” are configured by the software
                automatically. In “Analog Output”
                tab in “Hardware Configuration” section, you can see that the wiring of the device is set at “32A” with
                the maximum “Burden” of “400VA” and the “Binary/Analog” inputs 1 is activated for measuring the voltage.
                To better analyze the test,
                “Table View”, “Detail View” and “Signal View” windows can be used. After opening “Table View” window you
                can see that a “State” with the frequency of “50Hz” and in accordance with the entered information is
                made in “State Setting” section.

                values waveforms and the voltages recorded in “Signal View” it is possible to check the connections of
                the connectors. The results of the test can be viewed in “Result” section after the test is finished.
                The results include “linj”, the
                amount of injected current, “Vmeas”, the measured voltage, the impedance of the route, angle of the
                impedance and finally the values of “R” and “X” are displayed using “Z Cos phi” and “Z Sin phi”
                relations. In “Actual Burden” field, the
                amount of power which can be provided by the “CT” secondary in nominal current is measured and the
                result is displayed in this field by the software. In the end, after the test is finished, it is
                necessary to add the results of the evaluation
                to the report, which is done by selecting “Add to Report” in equipment test. / / / / Also, if you wish
                to add specific parts of the evaluation to the report or edit the report, you need to use “Add to

                accordance with the number of the intended binary. For example, to use the binary number “7”, “Bin7”
                should be selected as “Binary Input Target”
                while for binary number “5”, “Bin5” should be selected. / / / / / / Two notable points in performing a
                test are that “Error Other” means that there is a problem in the connection of the wirings or the
                resistance of the current route is
                too high that the device is not able to provide the “Burden” needed to inject the current. Therefore, in
                case of facing this error, check the “Actual” value of the current from “Signal View”. If the current is
                injected from the device
                “Actual Current” but difference with the specified current is too high, the indicator of high resistance
                of the route and that the “Actual Current” equals zero indicates that the current injection route is
                open. If the route resistance
                is too high, the test current should be decreased and if the “Actual Current” equals zero, the
                connectors’ connection should be checked. The other point is that the voltage read by the binaries of
                the device need to have similar cycles.
                If the read values have a too high or zero tolerance, this means that the connectors are not connected
                correctly. /

            <Search>WINDING RESISTANCE TEST Winding resistance test is performed in “Resistance Test” tab. In this test
                by injecting “DC” current into “CT” secondary and measuring the voltage through “Binary Input” and
                dividing the voltage by current, the “DC”
                resistance or “Rmeas” is calculated. Note that in the software there is a row by default. If the “CT”
                has more taps, by right-clicking and selecting “Add” you can make as many taps as the rows and test each
                tap. To perform this test you
                need to enter the current and time in “State Setting” section in “I test” and “State Time” fields
                respectively. The current limitation is “32” amps but a “5” amps current for “5”amp “CTs” and a “1” amp
                current for “1” amp “CTs” would be
                enough. / After entering the information, you need to set the wiring according to the figure. Note that
                by double-clicking on the picture you can maximize it. In this wiring, first short circuit “Ia1” and
                “Ib1” then parallel “Ia2” and
                “Ib2” with the capacitor box and here you need to connect “Ia2” to “S1” of the “CT” and connect “Ib2” to
                “S2” after. The reason for using the capacitor box is to compensate the self-inductor effect of the
                “CT”. There are 3 “1000” microfarad
                capacitors in this box and the red port is the positive polarity while the black port negative polarity
                of the capacitor. To measure the “DC” voltage, you should connect the “Input1” to the “CT” and further
                from the current connectors.
                Then, connect the output current which has been paralleled with the capacitor to the “CT”. Note that to
                perform the test you should to right-click on one of the rows and select “Apply Test”. By doing this,
                the current and time settings
                as well as the hardware settings related to the “Hardware Configuration” including the outputs and
                “Binary/Analog Inputs” are adjusted automatically. In “Analog Output” tab in “Hardware Configuration”
                section you can see that the wiring
                settings is set at “32A” with a “400” Volt-amperes burden and the “Binary/Analog Input1” is activated to
                measure the voltage. To better analyze the test you can use “Table View”, “Detail View” and “Signal
                View”. After opening “Table View”,
                you can see that two zero frequency states are made by the information of “State Setting”. The first
                state is used so that the “CT” current exits the transient state and turns constant. The second state is
                used to measure the current and
                voltage and to measure the resistance. Now if you wish to view more information, use “Detail View”
                window. / / / Performing the Test and Analyzing the Results After wiring, “1” amp and “2” seconds are
                entered as test current and time and
                10 RMS Accuracy is selected as time period and by right-clicking on one of the rows and selecting “Apply
                Test” the test is initiated. Note that in “Signal View”, the waveform of the actual current and the
                voltage measured by “Binary Input”
                is viewable. By using “Signal View” and the recorded current and voltage waveforms, it is possible to
                analyze the test and by using the “Actual” values and the recorded voltages, examine the connection of
                the connectors. / After the test
                is finished, by selecting the row in “Result”, it is easily possible to view the test results. The
                results include “Vdc”, the injected current, “Rnom” or “Max Rct”, the resistance measured in the current
                temperature, the resistance measured
                in the reference temperature and “Rdev” of the difference between “Rcorr” and “Rnom” in terms of
                percent. In “Correction Factor”, the current ambient temperature and the reference temperature as well
                as the material of the coil calculate
                correction factor. The information of this temperature is entered in “Reference Winding” field in “Test
                Object” and “Rcorr” is calculated by multiplying the “Rmeas” value by the “Correction Factor”. /
                Sometimes it is possible that in the
                CT test sheet, the resistance is measured in a temperature other than the one mentioned in the plate. If
                you wish to enter this resistance, you need to check “R Man. Ref. Temp.”. By doing so, this resistance
                and its temperature are considered
                as the reference. By doing this, in “Resistance Test” tab, “Temp. Manufacturer” column is added to the
                results table. In this column the temperature measured by the factory is calculated. In the end, after
                performing the test, if “Rcorr”
                is smaller than “Rnom”, the “Assessment” is passed, in otherwise it fails. After the assessment, you
                should add the results to the report via “Add to Report” in equipment test. / Also if you wish to add
                some specific parts to the report
                or delete and edit the report, you can use the “Add to Report” cog. By clicking on it, you can check the
                items that should be added to the report or if you don’t need them you can uncheck them. Note that after
                performing each test, the
                results are not automatically added to the report and it is necessary to add the results to the output
                report by selecting “Add to Report” after each test and before clearing the test. / In performing the
                test, note that in “Voltage Measurement
                Mode”, you need to select one of the radio-buttons in accordance with the maximum resistance specified
                in “Max Resistance” column. If during the test in the default mode an over voltage error appears, select
                “Bin01” with a maximum of “8”
                volts. If the measured resistance is less than the maximum resistance of the “Bin10”, use the “Input” 10
                for more accuracy. Also, if you wish to use a different wiring for the current, select “Apply Test” at
                least one time before. Then
                check “Don’t Change Hardware Setting” and select your desired wiring in “Hardware Configuration” and
                then select “Apply Test” again. / / Two notable points are that “Error Other” shows that there is a
                problem in the wirings or resistance
                is too high that the device is not able to provide the “Burden” to inject the current. Therefore, if
                this error appeared, examine the actual value of the current in the “Signal View”. If the current is
                injected “Actual Current” but its
                difference with the set current is too much, the wiring resistance is too high and if “Actual Current”
                is zero, the route is open. If the resistance is too high, the current should be decreased and if the
                “Actual Current” equals zero,
                you need to examine the connections. The other point is that if the measured voltage is zero or has too
                high tolerances, it means that the connectors are not connected correctly. / /

            <Search>“EXCITATION TEST” TAB, PART 1 Transformer Saturation: Before talking about the Excitation test, it
                is necessary to review some important subjects related to analyzing behavior of transformers including
                equivalent circuit and some electric
                and electromagnetic analyses. You can see a transformer equivalent circuit in the figure. In this
                circuit, “RP” and “RS” refer to the primary and secondary coils resistance respectively which occur as
                heat loss and increase in the temperature
                of the coil. “XP” and “XS”, on the other hand, indicate a part of the flux whose path is through air and
                is known as “leakage Flux”. / In the parallel branch, “Rc” is the indicator of core loss including eddy
                current and Hysteresis losses
                which occur as increase in the temperature of the core. The reason for parallelism of “RC” is that the
                losses caused by it are in accordance with the square of the input voltage. “Xm” indicates magnetizing
                inductance of the wires wrapped
                around the core of the transformer. / Transformer Loading and Its Effect on Transformer Saturation When
                the transformer is put “on-load”, it causes the secondary current to increase. When it happens, the flux
                caused by the secondary coil
                increases as well. Also, after the secondary current increases, the primary current increases as well
                which leads to an increase in the flux of the primary side. But since the changes in the secondary side
                current are bigger, the flux
                of the secondary side will be more than the primary side. Because of the influence of the opposite side
                of these two in the equivalent flux of the transformer core, the flux of the transformer decreases. / As
                a result, while the load drawn
                from the terminals of the power transformer increases, the core recedes from the saturation area.
                Therefore, in full-load it is possible to use a small core for the transformer, but since transformer is
                not always used in nominal load,
                by reducing the core, the decrease in the load, leads to the saturation of transformer. Therefore, to
                avoid transformer saturation in light load and change the waveform from sine wave, it is necessary to
                extend the transformer core. CT
                Saturation Curve As mentioned before, the power transformer recedes from saturation by increasing the
                current whereas CT gets closer to the saturation area. The reason for this is related to the voltage of
                parallel branch where, in the
                power transformer by increasing the current, voltage of the parallel branch decrease. However, in “CT”,
                by increasing the current, the voltage of the parallel branch in the secondary side increases and the
                “CT” saturates. / “CT” saturation
                in a power system is caused by increase in the primary current because of occurrence of a fault, which
                disables the “CT” to move the fault current to the secondary with the correct ratio. Since the
                saturation point of “CT” is related to
                voltage and parallel branch current, while doing this test, the secondary voltage increases and the
                point where by increasing the voltage by 10 percent, the drawn current increases by 50 percent is
                considered as the saturation point. In
                future videos the ways to enter the values and do the test for different “CT”s will be provided. / /

            <Search>“EXCITATION TEST” TAB, PART 2 To perform this test, the first parameter to be entered is the “CT”
                secondary resistance. This resistance is used to estimate the knee point and is selected from “Max RCT”
                field by default. But if the resistance
                test has already been done, this resistance is selected from “Rmeas”. Note that, since some users skip
                the resistance test and try to directly perform this test, this field can be edited manually. / In the
                "Efs" field, the knee point is
                estimated using the formula. The importance of this number is in calculating "Vend" to determine the
                final voltage of test evaluation. The assessment of this test is based on the finding of the knee point,
                so that if the knee point is
                found, the test is "Passed" and otherwise "Failed". Once the resistance value has been specified, the
                test settings is entered in "State Setting". If "Demagnetize" option is ticked, before performing the
                test evaluation, the software once
                demagnetizes the "CT" with "AC" voltage and current. so that the residual flux caused by theresistance
                test is removed. In this section, you must enter the time "Demagnetize" and voltage in a percentage of
                "Vend". / In the next step if
                “Calc. from Test Object” is checked, the software calculates the frequency and final voltage of the test
                by using the information entered in “Test Object”. If you wish to enter this manually, you should
                uncheck this option. In “Excitation
                Time Test” field, the test time is entered. Note that, it is possible to show the saturation curve with
                less fluctuation by increasing the test time. In “Choose Current Measurement Mode” section, it is
                possible to specify the maximum current
                from among “Low Current” with maximum 500 milliamps and “High Current” with maximum 800milliamps. Note
                that by selecting any of these options, the wiring changes. / Performing the Test and Analyzing the
                Results In this test, the test information
                is entered is this page in accordance with the information entered in “Test Object” and the performed
                resistance test. Also, the wiring is done according to the CT specifications which are different for
                different models of “CTs”. Note
                that in this wiring, output voltages is connected to the capacitor positive output and it is necessary
                that the two negative polarities of the capacitors are connected to each other. Then the positive
                polarity of the second capacitor is
                attached to the "S1" "CT" and the "S2" is connected to the device. It should also be noted that series
                capacitors are used to filter the “DC” voltage of the device. By pressing “Init Test”, the needed
                “States” are created in “Table View”
                and the necessary changes are automatically applied in “Signal View”. Note that the voltage is displayed
                in “Signal View” in form of “RMS” and it is possible to change the view to sine by selecting
                “Instantaneous” option. After performing
                the test, in “Signal View” you can see that first the “CT” is demagnetized and then the excitation test
                begins. In “Lissajous” tab, the saturation curve can be viewed in terms of voltage and current. In this
                curve the linear area between
                the two plus signs is depicted in pink. After finishing the test, the knee point and the saturation
                point are depicted with green and the results and the evaluation are recorded in “Excitation Result”
                section. Since in performing this
                test the saturation curve points are of significance too, by selecting “Add to Report” option, the
                points used for the test are added to the report. / Another important point in an excitation test is the
                current which passes the primary
                of “CT” and causes the saturation. Since this current is related to the CT connected resistance, in
                “Calculation of Iprimary” section, the connected resistance should be entered in “RL” field and then
                view the current that causes the CT
                saturation in “Iprim” field. Here you can see the formula used to calculate this current. / If you wish
                to set the wiring in a way other than the suggested way, after clicking on “Init Test”, check “Don’t
                Change Hardware Setting”, then
                make your desired changes and initiate the test. Note that if before finding the saturation and knee
                points, an “Overcurrent” error is displayed, the wiring needs to be changed from “Low Current” to “High
                Current” and then initiate the
                test after pressing “Init Test”. If again before finding the knee point the device is displaying an
                overcurrent error, this means that the knee point current is higher than the Range of the device and it
                is not possible to find the knee
                point using this device. /

        <contant id="CT_Excitation_Test_Part3">
            <Search>CT “EXCITATION TEST”, PART 3 Saturation phenomenon and non-linear behavior in transformer As you
                know, inductor is a linear element but if its voltage exceeds a specific limit, the inductor is
                saturated and enters the non-linear area. What
                we mean by saturation of the inductor is the saturation of its core. In fact, when the voltage exceeds
                the threshold, the core loses its ability to pass more flux and so it is saturated and the inductor
                turns non-linear. But by drawing
                the saturation curve of a “CT”, you can see that there is also a non-linear area in the lower voltages.
                Up to now we have said that in higher voltages the inductor becomes excited and turns non-linear. To
                explain non-linear area in a lower
                voltage, the parallel circuit of a “CT” is drawn. In this parallel circuit, the turns ratio of the “CT”
                which is a transformer is “1:N”. “Rs” indicate the resistance of the “CT”. In the parallel branch,
                “Reddy” and “Rh” stand for Foucault
                and hysteresis losses of the coil and L stands for the magnetizing inductance of the “CT” secondary. To
                perform the excitation test, secondary of the “CT” is fed by voltage and check to see what non-linear
                element is causing the “CT” to
                show a non-linear behavior even in lower voltages. / / As mentioned before, the losses of core include
                Foucault and hysteresis. Therefore, to analyze the non-linear behavior of the transformer, we need to
                examine the Foucault and hysteresis
                losses. Foucault losses are caused by Eddy Current which occurs in the core segment because of
                time-varying flux in the core and voltage induction. Since the flux is directly dependent on the
                voltage, we can say that the Foucault losses
                are the result of a pure resistance. The relation of the Foucault losses is achieved through an
                empirical method and is as you can see: / In this relation, “B” is the flux density which equals “V/f”.
                By substituting this relation, Foucault
                losses can be rewritten as Pf= V2/Re. / From this relation it can be deduced that the Foucault losses
                are caused by a fixed resistance that are not dependent on voltage and cannot be the reason for the
                non-linear behavior of the transformer
                in lower voltages. So, it is only possible that the hysteresis losses are the reason for the non-linear
                behavior in the “CT”. Hysteresis losses occur in the core due to the residual magnetism. This means that
                passing of the magnetic flux
                through the metal core in a direction causes the core to be magnetized and turn into a weak magnet; so
                in the next half-cycle, a small amount of energy is lost to remove the magnetic effect of the previous
                half-cycle and this is being
                constantly repeated. The empirical relation of hysteresis is as you can see: / / The value of “x”
                depends on the material of the core and can vary from 1.5 to 2.5. Also, in this relation, “B” is the
                flux density which equals “V/f” and
                by substituting it, the Hysteresis losses can be rewritten as you can see: / From the resulted relation,
                it is obvious that the hysteresis resistance is non-linear and dependent on the its voltage / The effect
                of this resistance in the
                total equivalent resistance of the “CT” in the lower voltages is significant. But from a specific
                voltage upwards, the effect of this resistance decreases and causes the “CT” current and voltage
                relation to approach linearity. This causes
                the relation between voltage and current to be non-linear in a specific range in the lower voltages. /

            <Search>CT EXCITATION TEST, PART 4 Saturation Point and Frequency Variation As mentioned earlier, the core
                losses include eddy current and hysteresis and its model is as you can see here: Pf= Ke V2 Ph=Kh* Vx
                /fx-1= Ph= Kh * f1-x * Vx-2 * V2 Pc= Pe
                + Ph = Ke V2 + Kh * f1-x * Vx-2 * V2 By using this relation, we can obtain the Foucault and hysteresis
                resistance models which Foucault resistance model is linear and independent from the voltage while
                hysteresis resistance model is non-linear
                and dependent on the voltage. Re=1/Ke Rh= 1/ Kh * f1-x * Vx-2 If voltage is fed from the secondary side,
                since Rct and the current drawn from the source is clear, the voltage of the parallel branch is
                calculated using: E= Vterminal –RCT
                * I After calculating E, the core losses are calculated using: Pc= E*I *Cos phi By having the core
                losses value and its extended formula Pc= Ke V2 + Kh * f1-x * Vx-2 * V2 It is possible to calculate Ke,
                Kh and X by solving the three equations
                in the three variables system. To solve these equations, it is possible to apply three different
                voltages. But if the frequency is the same, its determinant turns zero and no answer can be obtained for
                the variables. Therefore, it is better
                to apply one of the voltages with a different frequency. In the first step of solving these equations
                with V1 and f1 as voltage and frequency, Ke and Kh*f1-x parameters can be obtained using a two equations
                in the two variables system.
                Pc1= Ke V12 + Kh * f11-x * V1x-2 * V12 Pc2= Ke V22 + Kh * f11-x * V2x-2 * V22 Now, if one of the
                voltages is applied along with f2 as the frequency, “x” is obtained and by substituting it in Kh*f1-x,
                Kh obtained achieved as well. By specifying
                these parameters, the resistance of Foucault and Hysteresis obtained. Pc2= Ke V22 + Kh * f11-x * V2x-2 *
                V22 Pc3= Ke V2^2 + Kh * f21-x * V2x-2 * V22 Due to voltage application limit for CTs with a very high
                saturation point, it is possible
                to find the saturation point in the nominal frequency by decreasing the voltage and frequency with the
                same proportion. Because the relation of the according flux is V/f. But does not changing the frequency
                change the CT system? To explain
                this subject, we need to examine those components of the CT that are affected if the frequency and
                voltage are changed. According to previous analyses, Rct is dependent on the material of the wire and
                Reddy to the material of the coil.
                In Xm branch, due to the proportional change of V and f and the stability of the flux, this branch
                remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the only parameter affected by the voltage and frequency is
                hysteresis resistance which was obtained.
                Rh= 1/ Kh * f1-x * Vx-2 Now suppose that to obtain the saturation point, the fed voltage and frequency
                are split in two. Is it possible to obtain the saturation point in the nominal frequency by multiplying
                the voltage and current by two?
                This will be clarified later. Suppose that the CT knee point is obtained by decreasing the frequency to
                25 Hz with 500 volts of voltage and 15 milliamps of current. The voltage of the parallel branch is
                obtained using: EExc = Vterminal
                - Rct IExc Since now we have Ke، Kh and x, by dividing EExc by Reddy and Rh, Ia and Ih currents are
                calculated. By subtracting these two from IExc, the self-inductor current is obtained. According to this
                relation, Phi=L* I when the flux
                is fixed, the self-inductor current is fixed as well. Therefore, by doubling the voltage of the parallel
                branch, this current remains fixed. After doubling the voltage and frequency, as it is shoawn in this
                formula. Ieddy=2 Exct /Reddy
                Ih= 2 EExc /1/ Kh * f1-x * Vhx-2 = 2 EExc * Kh * 501-x * 2EExc x-2 Ie= 2 EExc * Ke The Foucault and
                hysteresis currents are calculated and added by self-inductor current to achieve lExc using this
                relation. Then, the voltage of the parallel
                branch which is 25Exc is added to Rct* lExc and the terminal voltage is obtained. Decreasing the
                Frequency and Performing the Test: As you know, the maximum output voltage of a device in one-phase mode
                is “450” volts. Usually, to avoid
                damaging the measuring equipment, measuring CTs go to saturation in low voltages. But the saturation
                voltage of some protection CTs such as “TPX”, “TPY” and “TPZ” is too high and usually this saturation
                point voltage is beyond the ability
                of the device. To test these CTs, it is possible to increase the voltage until the CT goes to saturation
                but some scientific references suggest that high voltages must not be fed into CTs because high voltages
                can damage the insulation
                resistance of the equipment. Another method for excitation test in CTs with too high saturation voltage
                is to decrease the frequency. This method is also mentioned in the standard CT excitation test, which
                can be performed with an “AMT105”
                device. As you saw, the knee point of a 5P10 protection CT in 50 Hz frequency was measured to be about
                159 volts. If you wish to specify the value of the final voltage and injected frequency manually, you
                need to uncheck “Calc. from Test
                Object” option and fill “Frequency” and “V end” fields. For example, “25 Hz” and “186 volts” are entered
                as frequency and final voltage respectively which means “372 volts” in “50 Hz” frequency. Note that by
                changing the voltage, it is
                so much probable that the wirings change as well. In this method, “Demagnetize” option is checked by
                default so that the magnetic residue is removed and the aforementioned calculations are done. / / After
                adjusting this settings and specifying
                the test time, click on “Init Test” to initiate the test. As you can see in the “Signal View”, by
                decreasing the frequency and equating, the knee point is almost equal with what was measured in 50 Hz
                frequency. Therefore, in cases where
                the CT saturation point voltage is beyond the limit of the device, by decreasing the frequency, you can
                measure the knee point and its saturation. /

            <Search>OTHER TESTS PERFORMABLE IN “EXCITATION TEST” TAB By checking “Extra Data”, the additional
                information obtained from the excitation test is displayed. In the table of this section, the drawn
                current is displayed in EFS with 110 percent. Moreover,
                in “Custom” row it is possible to enter the voltage and view the current drawn in that voltage. For
                example, the current drawn in a 50 volt is … amps. “Ratio Table” In fact, this table is the standard
                turns ratio table which is completed
                by the software during the excitation test. Note that this table is completed using voltage turns ratio
                and in different burdens. Let us use a numerical example to explain how this section works. To begin the
                calculations, suppose that
                “Burden= 15 VA”, Current equals 0.5ln, power factor equals 0.8 and CT resistance equals 2 ohms. To
                create the nominal burden in CT nominal current, we can suppose that a 12 ohm resistance is connected to
                the two ends of the terminal. 15VA
                * 0.8 = 12 VA = 1* 12 According to the equivalent circuit, in 0.5ln or 0.5 amp current, voltage of the
                parallel branch is achieved from EExc = Rct+RL * I = 2+12*0.5= 7 V According to the equivalent circuit,
                using the relation, voltage
                of the primary side is achieved as 7*1/500 =14mV. This number is the voltage which is in half of the
                nominal current to be measured in the primary. Therefore, to fill the 1.5ln and 15VA cells, the software
                needs to create the 7volt in
                the the parallel secondary branch and measure its equivalent in the primary and finally, compare the
                measured value with the applied value. To create a 7 volt in the parallel branch, the device and the
                software need to apply "Vterminal"
                voltage to the CT in accordance with the displayed relation. Vterminal= EEXC+Rct* I= Vterminal = 7+ 2*I
                Since the current loaded from the device can be viewed at any moment, the voltage of the device to
                create the 7 volt parallel branch
                is obtained. The mentioned process is repeated for all cells of this table and the turns ratio error,
                phase displacement, composite error and “ALF” are calculated for different burdens. To perform this
                test, after doing the wiring for
                excitation test, it is necessary to connect the CT primary to inputs 1 and 10 and run the test after
                pressing “Init Test”. You will see that after the test is finished, the turns ratio obtained from “Ratio
                Table” is displayed in “N Turn”.
                Other than this “Pol.Check”, the tables related to this section are completed and the those cells that
                have error values beyond the allowed range are highlighted in red and displayed in “Error List” section.
                In the last table, “ALF” is
                calculated and displayed in different burdens. Resistance Measurement By checking “Rdc”, the winding
                resistance is measured using the voltage application and current measurement method. For this test, the
                capacitors are “Bypassed” using
                the binary output 1 and DC voltage is applied to the CT. Afterwards, input 5 is connected to the “CT”
                using binary output 3 and the actual voltage of the CT are measured. As you saw, during the process of
                resistance measurement, Binary
                outputs are closed. In the end, the resistance is measured.

        <contant id="CT_ratio_and_polarity_test_with_current_method">
            <Search>CT RATIO AND POLARITY TEST WITH CURRENT METHOD To perform a ratio and polarity test you should use
                “Ratio and Polarity Test With Current” tab. In this tab, turns ratio, polarity and phase deviation
                between “CT” primary and secondary is performed
                where “AC” current is injected and the secondary current is measured through “Input9”. To perform this
                test, you need to enter the current and time of the test in “State Setting”, in “I test” and “State
                Time” fields respectively. Before
                initiating the test some points must be considered. / The first point is that the current limit is “128”
                amps while the “Binary/Analog Input9” limit is “500” milliamps. But since in sometimes the “CT”
                secondary current exceeds “500” milliamps
                which damages the “Input9”, “Icalc” is limited to “450” milliamps. This means that you can increase the
                primary as much as that “Icalc” does not exceed “450” milliamps. The second point is that if the route
                resistance is too high and the
                device is not able to provide the needed “Burden”, to perform the test you should decrease the
                resistance. To do so, you can parallel “4” pieces of wire. The third point is that if even by using “4”
                pieces of wire the problem is not solved,
                you need to decrease the current. Note that the test current must be based on the standard because the
                software uses that to assess the test. The table made in this section is the basic standard for test
                assessment where the allowed turns
                ratio error and phase deviation are specified in percent and “minute” for classes of protection and
                measurements “CTs”. In turns ratio section, the allowed error for different percentages of nominal
                current and in the “phase” section allowed
                error is specified in minute. For example, for a “Measuring CT” with the class of “0.5”, in “5” percent
                of the nominal current, “1.5” percent turns ratio and “90” minutes of phase deviation error are allowed.
                But in “Protection” mode,
                the maximum error is determined independently from the primary current. For example, for a “Protection
                CT” with the accuracy class of “10P10”, the maximum allowed turns ratio error is “3” percent and there
                is no limitation mentioned for
                phase deviation. / After entering the information in “State Setting”, you should set the wiring
                according to the picture. In this wiring ,short circuit “Ia1”, “Ib1”, “Ia2” and “Ib2” together and
                “Ia3”, “Ib3”, “Ia4” and “Ib4” together and
                then according to the picture, connect a wire to “Ia1” and “Ib4” phases after passing it through the
                “CT”. To measure the secondary current, connect “Input9” to “S1” and “S2”. After wiring, for “CT
                Protection 500/1”, “10” percent of the
                nominal current which equals “50” amps and “1” seconds as time are entered and the test runs after “Init
                Test” is pressed. You can view the “States” created by the software in “Table View”. If “At Calibration
                State” is checked, in the
                first state with zero current, the secondary is measured and is deducted from the final result. The
                second state is the same as the specified test current. Note that if “At Calibration State” is not
                checked, the noise is not removed from
                the response. In “Signal View” section, the waveform of the specified current along with its “Actual”
                values and the current measured by “Input9” can be viewed. After the test is finished, the results can
                be viewed in “Turns Ratio Results”.
                “Icalc” is the secondary current calculated by the software in accordance with the turns ratio entered
                in “Test Object” and the “Itest”. “Iactual” is the actual value of the injected current, “Imeas” is the
                measured current and “Turns
                Ratio Nom” is the “CT” nominal turns ratio. “Turns Ratio Act” is measured by comparing “Imeas” and
                “Iactual” and finally, the assessment is recorded in “Assessment” field in accordance with the
                difference between “Turns Ratio Act” and
                “Turns Ratio Nom”; if “Deviation act.” is less than the value specified in the standard, the test
                “Passes” otherwise it fails. Here, since the fault percentage is less than the value specified in the
                standard, the test is “Passed”. / In
                “Phase” section, In “Phase Nom” and “Phase Act” the nominal phase deviation and the measured phase
                deviation are specified respectively. In “Phase Dev”, by comparing “Phase act” and “Phase nom”, the
                error in terms of minutes is calculated
                and the assessment is specified in “Assessment” field. In “Polarity” section, “Pol.Check” field assesses
                the validity of the polarity. And in the end, after the test is performed, it is necessary to add the
                results of the assessment to
                the report which is done by selecting “Add to Report”. / If to perform the test in higher currents or to
                have more valid results, you wish to perform the test “Manually”, you should set “Choose Measurement
                Mode” at “Manual” mode and according
                to the picture, use an ammeter. After checking “Manual”, “Imeas” is editable and you can manually change
                its number. By entering this value, the software calculates the error and displays it. Note that in
                “Manual” mode it is only possible
                to perform the turns ratio test. After selecting “Manual” mode, connect the connectors of the “CT” to
                the ammeter and set the test time at “5” seconds. Then press “Init Test” to perform the test. After the
                test is finished, enter the number
                read by the ammeter in “Imeas” field so that the device can assess the test based on this value. In the
                end, after the test is finished, if you need to add the test results to the report, you can do that by
                selecting “Add to Report”. /
                Two notable points are that first, “Error Other” means that there is a problem in the connections or the
                route resistance is too high that the device is not able to provide the “Burden” need for current.
                Therefore, if you faced this error
                you should check the “Actual” value from “Signal View”. If the current is injected “Actual Current” but
                its difference with the specified current is too much, this means that the resistance is too high and if
                the “Actual Current” is zero,
                it means that the current injection route is open. If the route resistance is too high, the test current
                should be decreased or using several parallel routes and if the “Actual Current” is zero, the
                connections should be examined. The
                next point is that the current read by the device needs to have similar cycles. If the read values have
                too high tolerances or the tolerance is zero, it means that the connectors are not connected correctly.

                between “CT” primary and secondary with voltage
                are performed. In performing these tests, “AC” voltage is applied to “CT” secondary and the primary
                voltage is measured through “Analog Input”. To perform this test, you need to enter test voltage and
                time in “Vtest” and “State Time” fields
                in “State Setting” respectively. Note that this test must be performed after excitation test because the
                applied voltage must be in the “CT” linear areas. Before starting the test, some points must be taken
                into account. First: in this
                test, the voltage is applied form the secondary and measured from the primary. Two: if you wish to
                remove the noise from the result, check “At Calibration State” option. By checking this option in a
                “State” before the test, the “Input”
                voltage is measured and deducted from the result. / Generally, in “Table View” you can view the “States”
                that are created by the software. As you can see 5 “States” are created. In the first “State” 30 volts
                is applied, the “Actual” is
                measured and calibration factor is obtained from the difference between these two so that the test
                voltage is more accurate during the test. Note that while applying this voltage, the switches are open
                and no voltage is applied to the
                “CT”. The second “State” is related to “At Calibration State”. The fourth “State” is the specified test
                voltage and the third and fifth “States” are half and double the test voltage respectively which are
                created to measure the best state
                of the primary voltage. Note that this is why the maximum voltage limit is 220 volts. In “Voltage

                be connected to “S1” while “N” must be connected to “S2” and then a wire must be connected to “Input10”
                for measurement after passing through the “CT”. After doing the wiring, 50 volts and 1 second are
                entered as test voltage and test
                time for “CT Protection 500/1” and after pressing “Init Test”, the test starts. In “Signal View”, the
                waveform of the voltage along with its “Actual” value and the measured voltage can be viewed. After the
                test is finished, the results
                can be viewed in “Turns Ratio Result”. “Vactual”, “Vmeas” and “Turns Ratio Nom” are the actual value of
                the fed voltage, the measured voltage and the “CT” nominal turns ratio respectively. Also, “Turns Ratio
                Act” is measured by comparing
                “Vmeas” and “Vacutal” and finally, the assessment is recorded in assessment field in accordance with the
                difference between “Turns Ratio Act” and “Turns Ratio Nom”. If the difference is less than the allowed
                value in the standard, the
                test passes otherwise it fails. Here, since the error percentage is less than the specified value in the
                standard, the test is passed. This test is assessed in the way that when you specify a test voltage, the
                current is measured according
                to the “Burden” entered in “Test Object” and after performing the test and measuring the turns ratio
                error percentage, the result is compared with the current standards table and assessed. / / In “Phase
                Nom” field in “Phase” section, the
                phase and in “Phase Act”, the measured phase are specified. In “Phase Dev” by comparing “Phase act” and
                “Phase nom”, the error is calculated in minute and the assessment is specified in “Assessment” field.
                “Pol.Check” field in “Polarity”
                section checks the correctness of the polarity. Finally, after the test is performed, it is necessary to
                add the assessment to the report which is done by pressing “Add to Report”. Also, if you wish to add
                some specified parts to the report
                or delete the report you can use “Add to Report” cog. Note that if the test has been performed using
                inputs and outputs other than the default settings, first you need to click on “Init Test” and then
                check “Don’t Change Hardware Setting”
                and by going to “Hardware Configuration”, in “Analog Output”, activate phases of the intended voltage
                group and deactivate the rest and perform the test using the intended voltage group. Here voltage group
                A is deactivated and voltage
                group B is activated and instead of “Input 10”, “Input 8” is selected and the necessary settings is
                adjusted. / / Megger tab No test is performed in “Megger” tab. This section is designed so that you can
                enter “Megger” test result and
                gather all results in one report. You can enter the number of rows and columns that you need in “Rows”
                and “Column” fields respectively and by clicking on “Insert”, make your intended table and the results
                are added to the inserted fields.
                Also, in “Title” field you can enter a title for your test. / Finally, after all the tests are performed
                and the results are added to the report, in “Report View” it is possible to view the report as a whole.
                By right-clicking and selecting
                “Reorder Reports”, it is possible to change the arrangement of different test results. To do this, you
                need to select your intended report and by using “Up” and “Down” keys move the report or by using
                “Delete”, delete it. Furthermore,
                if you wish to delete the added report, or edit the entered information, you can use the blue option
                named “Edit & Delete Report”. / /

            <Search>INTRODUCING “CIRCUIT BREAKERCB” ROOM One of the Instrument which can be tested by an “AMT105” is
                “Circuit Breaker CB” with a maximum excitation current of “2.5” amps which is used to connect and
                disconnect lines and other high-voltage equipment.
                When a fault occurs in the equipment and lines, the CB automatically stops the faulty system. When there
                is a fault, the CB must be able to react with certainty and command automatically. The “AMT105” is
                capable of testing “Medium Voltage”
                CB with a maximum supply voltage of “210V” and “2.5amps” of “Coil Current”. By clicking on “Circuit
                BreakerCB” on the “Start” page, the “CB” test room opens. In this room, by adjusting the required
                settings, it is possible to perform “CB
                Time Test”, contact resistance and minimum voltage to operate test. “Test Object” and “Megger” tabs are
                used to enter the nominal information of “CB” and the results of “Megger” test respectively. / “Test
                Object” tab: Every room, to perform
                the test, needs some information about the equipment to be entered in “Test Object” tab. In “General
                Information” tab, information about the “CB” which should be added to the report is entered. In “Serial
                Number”, “Type”, “Station”, “Feeder/Bay”,
                “Phase” and “Manufacturer” fields, the serial number, type, name and address of the substation, feeder’s
                name, phase number and the name of the manufacturer are entered. / In “Operating Time” section, the
                minimum and maximum allowed times
                in different modes are entered. Since open command is sent to the “Breaker” bobbin, up to the moment the
                CB poles are detached is called “Opening Time” while since the “Close” command is sent, up to the moment
                the CB poles are closed is
                called “Closing Time” whose minimum and maximum allowed time should be entered in the related field.
                “Tmin” and “Tmax” fields in front of “Opening Sync” and “Closing Sync” determine the maximum allowed
                time difference between the opening
                of 3 poles and closing of 3 poles of the CB respectively. / Since the “open” command is sent to the
                breaker, up to the moment the CB poles are closed again after opening once, is known as “Open-Close
                Time” and its minimum and maximum allowed
                times are entered in the related field. In “Open Close Voltage Setting” section, the amount of the open
                and close voltage of CB bobbins is selected from among “AC & DC”. Also, in “Supply Voltage” and
                “Threshold” the amount of supply voltage
                and the threshold voltage to begin the measurement of the CB operation time are entered respectively.
                About “Threshold”, note that, when the voltage of the binary 7 or 8 goes below the value specified in
                this field, the device starts measuring
                the time. In “Resistance Contact” field, the ideal resistance of the CB poles are specified and the
                minimum and maximum allowed are entered in front of it. All the information of “Test Object” tab is
                entered from “Test Sheet” or the results
                of the previous tests. / / In “Extra Data” section, in “Date”, “Tested By” and “Approved By” fields,
                date of the test, information of the test man, and information of the supervisor are entered
                respectively. By checking “Easy Mode” option
                in “Accessories” section, the wiring format of the tests changes. This wiring is in accordance with the
                board designed for “CB” test by VEBKO company; this board is connect on the front panel and there are
                relays placed on it that can
                manage the wiring automatically which makes the test easier. The number entered in “Averaging” field
                indicates the number of cycles which are used for doing the calculations. This number is set at 1 by
                default. The more the number of cycles,
                the more cycles and time are considered for calculations by the software in “AC” and “DC” modes
                respectively. Doing this increases the calculations which leads to a more accurate test result. / By
                checking “Add to Report” option at the
                bottom of the page, this information is added to the report and the message “The report was added to the
                list” is displayed. It is possible to view the report by selecting “Report” from the strip at the right.
                By clicking on “Delete Report”
                in “Delete from Report” window, the report added is deleted. If “Set as default” is checked, the entered
                information is saved as default and by opening the “Circuit BreakerCB” room at any time, this
                information is displayed. /

        <contant id="CB_Timing_Test">
            <Search>CB “TIMING TEST” One of the most important tests performed in CB is “Timing Test”. To perform a
                “Timing Test” it is necessary to specify three main important sections including 1- Supplement method of
                bobbins, 2- Wiring type of “Binary Outputs”
                and 3- type of “Binary inputs”. / The supplement method of bobbins is specified in “Power Supply”
                section which is set at “AMT105” by default and its value is taken from “Test Object”. To control the
                voltage applied to “Open” and “Close”
                bobbins, “Binary Outputs” of the device are used. In “Binary Output” section it is specified that which
                “Binary Outputs” are to be used to control “Close” and “Open” commands which is set at “Series” by
                default. In this mode, huge voltages
                which occur during opening and closing are divided between the two relays which prevents damage to the
                device. But if one of the “Binary Outputs” is not available, by selecting other options, it is possible
                to use only two “Binaries”.
                For example, by selecting “Bin1” and “Bin4” you can only use the “Binaries” 1 and 4. In this
                instruction, “Series” mode is used. / “Binary Input” is used to sense when the CB is closed or open.
                Since there is noise in substations, “Binary
                Inputs” are set at “Wet” by default so noise is removed from the “Binary Inputs”. But if there is no
                noise in the test environment you can set the type of “Binary Inputs” at “Dry” and by changing the
                “Binary” type, the wiring changes as
                well. / Next you need to select the test type from among “Open—Close—Open Close--…” By selecting any of
                them, you need to enter the time in the specified box. For example, in “Open” test, you need to enter
                “three” times in the designed
                fields; the first “time” is related to before command, the second “time” is related to the Duration
                which the command is kept on the bobbin and the third time is related to after command. In this example,
                the bobbin is supplied by the
                device and “Binary Output” and “Binary Input” are set at “Series” and “Wet” respectively. For “Open”
                test, the default time values are considered as the time values. Then, you need to set the wiring
                according to the specified picture.
                Note that by double-clicking on the picture, it is possible to magnify it. In this wiring, the specified
                connections must be set, those points that have the same name must be connected to each other, Close and
                Open bobbins must be connected
                to the lower end of “Binary Outputs” number 3 and 4 and finally, the connections of “Binary Input” must
                be set to receive the key contacts. After setting the wiring, open “Signal View” and initiate the test
                by selecting “Init Test”. In
                “Signal View” window, it is possible to view the voltage and current loaded from the device as well as
                the CB opening time. “Vc1+” and “Vc2+” indicate the status of the “Close” command control “Binary
                Outputs” while “Vo1+” and “Vo2+” are
                indicators of the status of the “Open” command control “Binary Outputs”. “L1”, “L2” and “L3” indicate
                the status of the CB contacts: / / Three colored lines mean that the CB contacts are closed while no
                lines suggest the opposite. “AUX
                Open” and “AUX Close” signals are used to determine the origin time for measuring the performance time.
                As mentioned before, the CB performance is measured since when the voltage of the “Binaries” 7 and 8
                exceeds the “Threshold” specified
                in “Test Object”. Moreover, the test results are available in “Summary of Result” section. In this
                section, the peak current and “Steady State” current and in the “Open” table the opening time of each
                contact is provided separately. Note
                that the evaluation of these times is done in accordance with the “Opening Time” and “Opening Sync”
                specified in “Test Object”. If the operating time is somewhere within the range specified in “Test
                Object” the test “Passes”, otherwise
                it “Fails”. For adding the results to the report, you can do so by pressing “Add to Report”. Also, if
                you wish to add some specific parts to the report, or delete and edit the report, you need to use the
                “Add to Report” cog. By clicking
                on this cog, you can view the items that can be added to the report. If you do not need each of them,
                you can unselect by unchecking them. Note that after performing a test the results are not automatically
                added to the report and it is
                necessary to add the results to the report by “Add To Report” before “Clearing” the test. / / In the
                following, some points about the test are provided: The first point is that if you wish to use only one
                voltage group, first you need
                to press “Init Test” and then check “Don’t Change Hardware Setting” and by going to the “Hardware
                Configuration”, activate your intended voltage phases and deactivate the others in the “Analog Output”
                tab and perform the test using only
                the voltages of the intended group. For example, here voltage group “A” is activated and voltage group
                “B” is deactivated. / The second point is that when you enter “150” milliseconds as the command time,
                this means that the command voltage
                is kept on the bobbin for “150” milliseconds. If you check “Command Termination Trigger” option and
                enter “10” milliamps as the “Minimum Time”, the command is removed from the CB, “10” milliseconds after
                its operation. To view this item,
                “Close” test is selected. To initiate the test, “Init” is pressed and test starts. After that, you can
                see that because of checking this option, unlike the previous case, “10” milliseconds after the CB
                operation the command is removed.
                / The third point is that if the current needed to exciting the bobbin is more than “2.5” amps, it is
                necessary to use an external source. In this case, check the “External” option and set the new wiring
                and start the test after pressing
                “Init Test”. If you are using an external source to provide the voltage of the bobbins, to better
                protect the bobbins, put a glass relay with the “Binary Outputs” in series so that if something
                unexpected happened to the “Binary Outputs”
                which made them no longer able to disconnect the voltage applied to the bobbins, the CB is not damaged
                and in this way you can have more control on connecting and disconnecting the supply applied to them. In
                using a glass relay, since
                the voltage of the binaries number 7 and 8 is used as the time origin, delay of the glass relay has no
                effect on the test result and this delay is deleted by the software. / Also, when testing the CB time
                test, it is necessary to know
                the current loaded by the CB. A “100” milliohm resistance is considered for this and when the current
                flow, a voltage is measured by the “Binary Input” 10 and by dividing the voltage by the resistance,
                “Coil Current” is calculated by the
                software and displayed in “Coil Current” section in “Signal View”. / / The third point is that “Error
                Other” while performing a test means that there is an issue with the connections or the high current
                loaded by the bobbins in a way that
                the device is unable to provide needed current. Therefore, in case of encountering this error, check the
                “Actual Current” value in “Signal View”. If the “Actual Current” reaches “2.5” amps and then the test is
                stopped, it means that the
                device is not capable of injecting that current and an external source should be used. If the time
                recorded in the table is “-1ks”, this means that the CB has been “Open” before performing the test or it
                has been closed for the “Close”
                test of the CB. In this case, other than the wiring, you need to check whether the CB is closed or open.

        <contant id="Contact_Resistance_test">
            <Search>“CONTACT RESISTANCE” TAB In this tab, ohm resistance test of CB contacts is performed. The test
                settings include “I Test” and “State Time” is specified in “Test Setting”. As you know, the method used
                by “AMT105” to measure the resistance is
                dividing the measured voltage by the injected current. In “Voltage Measurement Mode” section, you can
                select from among inputs “1” and “10” for the measurement in accordance with the voltage level and the
                maximum CB contact resistance.
                As you can see, “Bin 01” has two voltage levels for the measurement. The first level is “4.5” volts on
                “Wet4.5” while the second level is on “Wet30” but since the device current resources can only produce up
                to “8” volts, this item is
                limited to “8” volts. / In “Result” section, the ohm resistance measurement result of each contact is
                displayed. To perform this test, first, you need to add as many rows as the contacts by right-clicking
                and clicking “Add”. Then, set
                the wirings in accordance with the specified picture. Note that by double-clicking on this picture you
                can magnify it. In this wiring, you need to “Jumper “la1”, “lb1”, “la2” and “lb2” together and “la3”,
                “lb3”, “la4” and “lb4” together
                and connect “la1” and “la4” phases to the CB contact in accordance with the picture. To measure the
                voltage, the selected “Binary Input” should be connected to the CB contact and further from the current
                connectors. Note that to perform
                the test using a clamp and injecting high currents, multiple parallel wires should be used and they
                should be connected to the side where there are three pins while the voltage measuring wire should be
                connected to the side where there
                is only one pin. To perform the test, right-click on the phase related to that row and select “Apply
                Test”. In “Signal View” section, the waveform of the current along with its “Actual” values and the
                measured voltage can be viewed. Also,
                in “Table View”, you can see that two “States” are created in accordance with the settings specified in
                “Test Setting” and the test is performed. Note that, to test each contact, you need to add the related
                row in “Result” section and
                test each contact separately by setting the specified wiring. / / / In this table, custom name, name of
                the phase, the measured voltage, the actual injected current, the measured resistance and the result of
                the assessment are entered
                in “Name”, “Phase”, “V DC”, ‘I DC”, “Rmeas” and “Assessment” fields respectively. Note that the test
                assessment is done by comparing the resistance entered in “Test Object” and the measured resistance. /
                In the end, after the test is performed,
                the results should be added to the report which is done by clicking on “Add to Report”. Also, if you
                wish to add specific parts of the test to the report delete or edit it, you can use the “Add to Report”
                cog. By clicking on this cog,
                you can see that the items that can be added to the “Report” are checked and if you do not wish any of
                these items to be added to the report, you can simply uncheck your intended item. Also note that the
                test results are not automatically
                added to the report after performing a test and it is necessary to add the results to the report by
                selecting “Add to Report” before “Clearing the test”. / In performing this test, it is imperative to
                note the following: First: “Error
                Other” in performing the test means that there is a problem in connections or the current route
                resistance is too high that the device is not able to provide the “Burden” needed to inject the current.
                Therefore, in this case, check the
                “Actual current” from “Signal View”. If the current is injected “Actual Current” but the difference with
                the specified current is too large, this indicates the high route resistance and if the “Actual Current”
                equals zero, this means that
                the current injection route is open. In the cases where the route resistance is high, the test current
                must be decreased and if the “Actual Current” equals zero, the connections must be examined. make sure
                the CB is closed. / Second: the
                measured voltage must have similar cycles. A high tolerance or a zero voltage means that the connectors
                are not connected correctly. Third: in cases of facing “Error: Over Voltage”, you need to select the
                “Input” with the bigger “Max Voltage”
                from “Voltage Measurement Mode” section. / Fourth: if you wish to modify wiring or use binaries other
                than “1” and “10”, first you need to check “Don’t Change Hardware Setting” and then apply the desired
                hardware modifications. / Fifth:
                “at Calibration State” option is used to remove the ambient noise effect from the voltage of the
                binaries. If this option is checked, in the first “State” the voltage is measured and deducted from the
                final result. /

            <Search>CIRCUIT BREAKER OPERATION MINIMUM VOLTAGE TEST: One of the most important tests that can be
                performed on circuit breakers is the “Circuit breaker operation minimum voltage test” or “Minimum
                Voltage” which is performed in “Minimum Voltage to
                Operate Circuit Breaker” tab. In this test, it is possible to find the minimum voltage which can cause
                the circuit breaker to operate by gradually increasing the voltage applied to the two ends of “Open” or
                “Close” bobbin. / In the first
                step of this test, the equipment to be used in the test is selected from among “New Device” and “AMT105”
                which is set at “AMT105” by default and here we proceed without changing it. Then you need to specify
                that whether you are going to
                perform a “Close” test or an “Open” test. Note that since some circuit breakers have two “Open” and two
                “Close” bobbins, there are “Open1” and “Open2” as well as “Close1” and “Close2”. In this video we are
                going to perform the minimum
                voltage test once for “Close” mode and once more for “Open” mode. / As the next step, you need to
                specify that whether the device is to detect the circuit breaker operation based on the contact
                reception or current drop; in this video
                we are using the former which is a more accurate and reliable method. In this method you can also
                specify that whether the test is to be performed in three-phase or single phase mode; here three-phase
                is selected. “Wet” is selected as
                the contact type so that noises cannot cause any dysfunction in the process. Note that by selecting any
                of the options in this section, the wiring changes. For example, if single phase or “Dry” are selected,
                you can see the change in the
                wiring. / In this test two methods are available to apply voltage to stimulate the bobbin. Using the
                “Manual” method, you specify a particular voltage and after pressing “Init Test”, apply that to the
                circuit breaker. But in “Pulse Ramping”
                method you can increase the voltage gradually and find the minimum voltage which can cause the circuit
                breaker to operate. By selecting “Pulse Ramping”, a graphic figure is displayed whose different
                parameters must be specified. Let us
                explain this with an example. / / In this example the voltage is increased from 35 to 80 volts with 0.5
                volt steps and each step takes 0.5 second. The value for “Reset” voltage is 5 volts and its application
                time is considered to be 0.5
                second. After specifying these factors, the wiring is done according to the guide available in the
                picture. In this wiring, first, the two voltage sources are paralleled in order to use the maximum
                current of the device, and then they
                are connected to the control coil to apply the fed voltage. Afterward, in accordance with the number of
                contacts selected, 3 is selected in this test L1, L2 and L3 contacts are connected to Binary Inputs to
                record the operation of the
                circuit breaker. After selecting “Coil Close1” and adjusting the wiring, “Init Test” is selected and the
                test runs. By opening the “Signal View” window you can view the applied voltage as well as the injected
                current. After the circuit
                breaker operates, the minimum operation voltage along with the amount of current drawn during the
                operation is displayed in “Result” section. By selecting “Add to Report” the test result is added to the
                output report. To test the “Open”
                bobbin of the circuit breaker, “Coil Open1” is selected and after pressing ‘Init Test” the test is
                reruned and the results are added to the output report. / In using the “Coil current” method the wiring
                is changed and the circuit breaker
                operation is detected based on the current drawn from the resource. You need to specify the minimum
                current which is drawn from the device when the circuit breaker operates in “Min Coil Current” field.
                Here 1.5 amp is selected. For “Pulse
                Ramping” the same settings used in the previous example are used. After adjusting the wiring and
                pressing “Init Test” the test runs. In “Signal View” you can see that for every “Pulse”, current is
                drawn from the device and in current ….
                And voltage ….. the test result is achieved and the results are recorded in “Result”. The results of
                this test are added to the report by selecting “Add to Report”. / / / / / / / / Post “DC” resource test:
                it is possible to perform the
                post “DC” resource test in “Check DC Ground” section. In posts whose potential difference is provided by
                two resources, it is possible to examine the parallelism of the two. For example, if the post uses a
                positive 100 volts and a negative
                100 volts resource to provide 200 volts of “DC” potential difference, by performing this test, it is
                possible to examine that how much is each of these two potentials deflected from the intended 100 volts.
                To do this test, you need to
                specify the nominal voltage and maximum allowed tolerance after checking “Check DC Ground”. Here “100
                volts” and “%10” are entered as the required values and then the wiring is adjusted in accordance with
                the figure. After pressing “Init
                Test” and running the test, in “Plus Voltage” and “Plus Voltage dev”, the positive potential difference
                and its difference with “Nominal Voltage”, “Negative Voltage” and “Negative Voltage dev” as well as the
                negative potential and its
                difference with “Nominal Voltage” are displayed. / / “Check Corresponding”: since in some electrical
                installations multiple voltage resources are used to supply different equipment, it may be necessary to
                test the positive and negative
                potential of the existing cables so that no mistake occurs in terms of positive and negative potentials.
                For this test, the maximum voltage allowed between the two poles of the two resources is entered in
                “Voltage Drop” field. To be precise,
                suppose that two resources of “A” and “B” are being used to supply the equipment. Normally there should
                not be any potential difference between the positive “A” and negative “B” sides of the resources. If
                there is any potential difference
                between these two it means that they both belong to the same resource and can be used to supply the
                equipment. / “Check Short Circuit”: by doing this test you can test the health of a bobbin. To do so you
                need to specify a voltage and
                a reference resistance in “Voltage” and “Rref” fields respectively. After doing the wiring and running
                the test, the drawn current is measured and then the applied voltage is divided by the drawn current and
                the self-resistance is calculated.
                If this resistance is smaller than the reference resistance specified in “Rref” field, it means that the
                self is short circuited. / / / Since it may happen that some users have also performed “Megger” test for
                this equipment and they wish
                to have the results in a report, in this tab they can create their intended table by selecting their
                desired row and column and then “Insert”; after entering the test results and selecting “Add to Report”,
                the information will be added
                to the output report. Other options include “Delete Report” which is used to delete the information of
                this page from the report as well as “Export” and “Import” options which are used to export the
                information of this page or import them
                if necessary. Also, if you wish to set the characteristics entered for the created row and column as the
                default for this section of the room you can use “Set as Default” option. / /

        <contant id="CVT_Voltage_transformers">
            <Search>CAPACITIVE VOLTAGE TRANSFORMERS Voltage transformers are composed of a core, two windings, and
                insulation. VTs convert the high voltage of the primary side to low voltage on their secondary winding
                with the turn ratio written on their plate.
                / Because of the internal casualties such as copper and iron casualties, the vector of the secondary
                voltage is different from the primary voltage. Moreover, the connected burden is capable of affecting
                the turn ratio error and phase displacement.
                If the actual amplitude of the secondary voltage is lower than nominal secondary voltage, the amplitude
                error is negative. Also, if the secondary vector is lagging in relation to the primary vector, the phase
                error is negative. / / To
                compensate for the turn ratio error, sometimes manufacturers adjust the number of primary or secondary
                turns. Nowadays, most of the VTs that are used in the industry are either inductive VTs or capacitive
                VTs which are called “CVT”. /
                CVTs are composed of an inductive VT, a high-voltage capacitive divider and a compensator reactor. In
                the IEC standard, the title CVT is used for this equipment but in the ANSI standard, this equipment is
                called CCVT. The compensator rector
                is designed in a way that it can compensate for the phase displacement caused by the capacitive divider.
                / All CVTs can be used for measurement purposes but only certain types of this equipment are suitable
                for protection purposes. Dual-purpose
                CVTs measurement and protection must be in accordance with all of the considered descriptions and the
                current standards. / According to the maximum allowed error percentage, the accuracy class of the
                protection CVTs is considered to be
                from 5 percent of the nominal voltage to a coefficient of the nominal voltage Rated Voltage Factor and
                after its value, the letter P is used. 3P and 6P are the standard accuracy classes for protection CVTs.
                For example, 3P accuracy class
                means that the maximum allowed error is 3 percent. Moreover, in IEC standard, three classes of T1, T2
                and T3 are considered for the function of CVT in transient state. For example, 3PT2 class indicates that
                the function of the 3P class
                is for protection purposes and T2 class is for transient states. / Classes related to the transient
                response are defined in the following table: / In the above relation, Us t is the response for the
                transient secondary voltage. For example,
                for the 3PT2 class, the relation of the transient voltage to the nominal voltage peak from 10 ms to 90
                ms after the beginning of the transient state, It should decreas and be in the range of less than 25
                times to 0.2. In this regard, it
                is necessary to pay attention to several points: CVTs need a damping piece of equipment for the 6PT3 and
                3PT3 transient response classes. By agreement between the manufacturer company and the customer, it is
                possible to consider different
                values for the turn ratio and Ts time. Selecting the transient response class depends on the
                characteristics of the protection relays. / About Measuring CVTs, the accuracy class is defined based on
                the highest allowed error percentage
                in the nominal voltage with the nominal burden. The standard accuracy classes for single-phase Measuring
                CVTs are considered to be 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0. / Test Object tab To perform a test, every module needs

                the waveforms of “Actual” and the voltages recorded in “Signal View” it is possible to examine the
                connection of the connectors. In
                “Result” section, the user can view the results after the test is finished. The results include “linj”,
                the amount of injected current, “Vmeas”, the measured voltage, impedance, “impedance Angle” and finally
                the values of “R” and “X” are
                displayed using the “Z Cosphi” and “Z Sinphi” relations, respectively. In “Actual Burden” field, the
                amount of burden that the “CT” secondary can supply in the nominal current is calculated and the result
                is entered in this field by the
                software. In the end, after the test is finished, it is necessary to add the test results to the report
                which, in equipment test, is done by pressing “Add to Report”. / Also, if you wish to add certain parts
                of the evaluation to the report
                or to edit the report, use “Add to Report” cog. By clicking on this cog, the elements that can be added
                to the “Report” are displayed by checked checkboxes and you can uncheck any undesired elements. Note
                that after any test, the results
                are not automatically added to the report and it is necessary to add the results of the performed test
                to the output report by pressing “Add To Report” before “Clearing the test”. It should also be noted
                that if the “Burden” of the path
                is low and the user wishes to have a more accurate measurement or “Binary/Analog Input1” is damaged, it
                is necessary to change the specified “Binary Input”. To do this, after pressing “Init Test” and checking
                “Don’t Change Hardware Setting”
                option, the user must enter “Hardware Configuration” window and specify a new input in “Binary/Analog
                Input” tab. Here, as an example, “Input10” is selected and after adjusting the necessary settings, the
                test is performed and the results
                are viewed. If you wish to select a binary between binaries “1” to “8”, you have to enter the “Binary
                Input Target” in accordance with the default binary number. For example, to use “Input7”, “Bin1” must be
                selected as the “Binary Input
                Target”. For this, it is suggested to right-click on “Input1” row and “Cut” the information and “Paste”
                it in the intended row. To change the current wiring, it should be noted that the “Output Target” of the
                selected wiring must be “lL1”.
                / / / / / Two more notable points in performing the test are that first, “Error Other” in a test
                indicates that there is a problem in the connection of wirings of the current path or resistance is too
                high that the device is unable to
                provide the “Burden” needed for current injection. Therefore, in cases of facing this error, you can go
                to “Signal View” and examine the “Actual” value of the current. If the current is injected by the device
                “Actual Current” but its difference
                with the specified current is high, this means that the path resistance is high and if the “Actual
                Current” is zero, it means that the current injection path is open. Where the path resistance is high,
                the test current must be decreased
                and in cases of a zero “Actual Current”, the connection of connectors needs to be examined. The second
                point is that the voltage measured by the inputs of the device needs to have similar cycles. If the
                measured values have too big tolerances
                or they are zero it means that the connectors are not correctly connected. / /

                voltage by current, “DC” resistance or “Rmeas”
                is calculated. It should be noted that in the software, there is only one row in the test table by
                default. If the “CVT” has more than one taps or cores, by pressing “Insert Rows” it is possible to add
                as many rows as necessary and test

                in equipment test is done by pressing
                “Add to Report”. / Also, if you wish to add specific parts of the test to the report or edit or delete
                the report, “Add to Report” cog. By clicking on this cog, the elements that can be added to the report

                it is necessary to add the results of the performed test to the report by pressing “Add to Report”
                before clearing the test. If you wish to use a different wiring for current injection, you need to have
                pressed “Apply Test” at least once.
                Then, check “Don’t change Hardware Setting” and select their intended wiring in “Hardware Configuration”
                and press “Apply Test” one more time. To select a different “Input”, it should be noted that the
                selected “Binary Input Target” must
                be similar to the default “Binary Input Target”. For this, it is suggested to right-click on “Input1”
                row and cut the information and “Paste” it in the intended row. To change the current wiring, it is
                important to set the “Output Target”
                of the selected wiring at “IL1”. / / / There are two more notable points; the first one is that „Error
                Other“ indicates that either there is a problem with the wirings or the resistance is too high that the
                device is not able to provide
                the „Burden“ needed for current injection. Therefore, in cases of facing this error, the user needs to
                examine the „Actual“ value of the current from „Signal View“. If the current is injected from the device
                „Actual Current“ but its difference
                with the specified current is high, the wiring resistance is too high and if the „Actual Current“ is
                zero, it means that the current injection path is open. In cases where the resistance is too high, it is
                necessary to decrease the current
                and when the „Actual Current“ equals zero, the connection of the connectors needs to be checked. The
                second point is that if the measured voltage has a too high tolerance or equals zero, this means that
                the connectors are not connected
                correctly. / /

                this test, by decreasing the frequency, a method is used to keep the voltage at a safe level. The core
                flux is in accordance with the relation
                between the voltage and the frequency and by using this relation and to prevent high voltages in CVT
                primary, it is possible to use a lower voltage for the test by decreasing the frequency. It should be
                noted that the software calculates
                and displays the saturation point in the nominal frequency. Moreover, decreasing the frequency helps to
                remove the effects caused by the stray capacity of the primary side. / Since the CVT damping circuit is
                used to stop the Ferro resonance
                effects, before performing the saturation test, it is necessary to isolate its circuit from CVT.
                Moreover, to perform coil resistance, secondary short-circuit impedance and saturation tests, it is
                necessary to detach the PLC/NHF terminal
                from the ground so that the high voltage does not cause any problem. Doing the wiring in accordance with
                the picture and applying AC voltage to the secondary coil, the saturation curve is obtained. In this
                process, the voltage of the secondary
                terminal, excitation current and the phase angle between the excitation voltage and current are
                measured. In this room, first, it is necessary for the amount of voltage intended for the test,
                frequency and test duration to be entered in
                “State Setting” section. In this section, in fact, “Vtest” is “Vend” and, in this field, the test
                voltage increases from zero to the specified voltage. / In “Demagnetize” section, before performing the
                saturation test, the software demagnetizes
                the “CVT” by AC voltage so that the residue flux caused by the “DC” resistance test is eliminated. In
                this section it is necessary to enter the “Demagnetization” time and the voltage in terms of a
                percentage of the “Vend”. / In “Choose
                Current Measurement Mode” section, it is possible to specify the current measurement mode so that the
                proper algorithm is applied in accordance with the current range. In this case, it should be noted that
                if the load current is low, it
                is better to use “Low current” mode because in this mode, the accuracy of load current measurement is
                higher. / Performing the test and analyzing the results To perform this test, as an example, 20 volts,
                10 Hz, 15s, and “High Current”
                are entered as “Vtest”, frequency, and test time and test mode. On this page a warning can be seen which
                says that in this test the primary side voltage will reach 36000 volts. Therefore, while performing this
                test, observing safety points
                is required. After specifying the settings, the wiring should be done in accordance with the picture. In
                this wiring, the voltage of the first phase of the device is connected to the positive polarity of the
                capacitor and after connecting
                two negative polarity of the capacitors, the positive polarity of the second capacitor is connected to
                the positive polarity of the “CVT” and the other polarity of the “CVT” is connected to the null of the
                device. The reason for using
                the connections of capacitors in the path of applying voltage to the “CVT” is to filter the “DC” offset
                which is caused by the linear amplifier of the device. / / / / After doing the wiring, “Signal View”
                window is opened so that the signals
                of the load voltage and current and also the saturation curve can be viewed during the test. After
                completing these steps it is necessary to click on “Init Test” every time before performing the test so
                that the settings needed for the
                test are adjusted automatically. By running the test, it can be seen that first, the “CVT” is
                “Demagnetized” and then the saturation test is performed. After the test is finished, the test voltage
                and current are displayed on the diagram
                in “Excitation Result” box. After the test is finished, to add the test results to the report, click on
                “Add to Report”. Also, by using the cog next to this option, before selecting “Add to Report”, uncheck
                any item that you do not wish
                to be added to the report. / / / If for any reason, you wish to use a voltage other than the voltage of
                the first phase, first, press “Init Test” and then check “Don’t Change Hardware Setting” option and then
                select a different output
                from “Hardware Configuration” window and set its “Output Target” at “VL1-E” and after changing the
                wiring, run the test. / / Note that if the device displays an “Overcurrent” error before finding the
                knee and saturation points, the wiring
                needs to be changed to “High Current” and the test can run after pressing “Init Test”. If again, the
                device displays an “Overcurrent” error before finding the saturation point, this means that the
                saturation point current is higher than
                the “limits” of the device and it is not possible to find the knee point using this device.

                IEC 60044-2 standard, the allowed error percentage is set in accordance with the accuracy class of the
                CVT. The first column of this
                accuracy class table and the turn ratio error percentage accuracy column are also available. In the
                following table, the mentioned error percentages are for cases where the voltage is higher than 2
                percent of the nominal voltage. In accordance
                with the table related to protection CVTs, for example, if the accuracy class is 3P, its allowed error
                percentage in 2 percent of the nominal voltage is 6 percent and in 100 percent of the nominal voltage is
                3 percent. / To perform this
                test, first, fields of “State Settings“ section are introduced. In “V test“, “V actual“, “State Time“
                and “Analog Input“ fields, the amount of test voltage, the actual applied voltage, the duration of the
                test and the input intended for
                transformer secondary voltage measurement are specified, respectively. It should be mentioned that
                inputs number 1 to 8 and input10 are used for voltage measurement. / / In noisy environments, there is
                some voltage on the inputs of the
                device and to increase accuracy, by selecting “At calibration state“ option, at the beginning of the
                test,another state with zero as its value is created and in the end, this measured voltage will be
                reduced from the final result. In “Turns
                Ratio Result”, the results of turn ratio test of every core are displayed after performing the test. In
                “V calc” field, the secondary voltage is calculated by the software in accordance with the values
                entered in “Test Object” and in “V
                test” field. In “V meas”, “Ratio Nom.” and “Ratio Act.”, the voltage measured by the input, the nominal
                turn ratio and the actual turn ratio are calculated by the software, respectively. / The insertion
                position of the cores is specified
                in “Insert Mode” in a way that by selecting “All Core”, all cores are added to the “Result” table based
                on the selection between “Up” or “Down”. Also, by selecting “Specific core”, a specific core is added to
                the table in accordance with
                the choice of the user. / In “Phase” section, in “Phase Nom” field, the amount of applied voltage to the
                CVT and in “Phase Act” the phase difference between the two sides of the transformer are displayed. In
                “Phase Dev” the deviation of
                the measured phase in relation to the applied phase is recorded in terms of minutes one degree equals 60
                minutes. Finally, the results of the evaluation are determined in accordance with the type of the core
                which can be protection, measurement
                or protection/measurement and also in accordance with what the user selects in “Assessment”. / The
                insertion position of the cores in the table is specified by selecting the options available in “Insert
                Position”. Tables can be added by
                pressing “Insert Rows” button. / / PERFORMING THE TEST AND ANALYZING THE RESULTS To perform the test, as
                an example, 100 volts and 300 milliseconds are entered as the test voltage and State time, respectively.
                The CVT is Protection type
                and only Core1 is going to be tested as an example. After pressing “Insert Rows”, since there are 3
                cores, 9 rows are inserted which in accordance with the test voltage and the CVT turn ratio / to/, the
                nominal turn ratio value and Vcalc
                are 181.8 and 550mV respectively. / To perform the test, the voltage of group A is connected to the CVT
                primary and the Input1 is connected to the CVT secondary to measure the voltage. To view the primary and
                secondary voltages during
                the test, Signal view is used. In the end, the intended row is selected and after right-clicking on it,
                Apply Test is selected. After the test, it can be seen that the test results are recorded in the table
                and since the angle fault and
                the turn ratio are within the range allowed in the standard, the test is passed. Other cores and phases
                are tested following the same procedure. / / / / / After the test is finished, to add the results to the
                report “Add to Report” option
                can be used. Also, by using the cog next to this option, you can remove the items that do not wish to be
                added to the report before selecting “Add to Report” option. / If, for any reason, wish to modify the
                wiring of the device, first
                they need to apply the test once and then check “Don’t Change Hardware Setting” option and select a
                different output from “Hardware Configuration” window and then set the Output Target at “VL1-E” and run
                the test after changing the wiring.
                To select other inputs, it should be noted that the selected Binary Input Target must be in accordance
                with the default “Binary Input Target”. For this, it is suggested to right-click on “Input1” row and
                “Cut” the information and “Paste”
                it in the intended row. / / / / / Since it is possible that some users have also performed a “Megger”
                test for this equipment and they wish to have its results in a report, in “Megger Test Report” tab, they
                can select their intended row
                and column and by pressing “Insert”, created their required table and after inserting the test results
                and selecting “Add to Report”, add the information to the output report. Other options such as “Delete
                Report” are used to delete information
                of this page from the report. Also, “Export” and “Import” options are used to export the information of
                this page as an output file and import it if necessary. If the user wishes to set the characteristics of
                the created row and column

                person who is performing the test and the information regarding the supervisor are entered in “Date”,
                “Tested by” and “Approved by” fields respectively. / / By checking “Easy Mode” option in “Accessories”
                section, the wiring type of tests
                changes. This wiring is in accordance with the board which is designed by Vebko Company to test the
                transformer. This board is located on the front panel of the device and on it there are relays to do the
                wirings of the front panel of
                the device automatically which makes performing the test easier. / In “Winding Configuration” section,
                the vector group of the transformer as well as the type of wiring of its two ends are selected. The
                wiring type of the primary and secondary
                windings are entered in “Primary H” and “SecondaryX” fields and if there is a third winding, its wiring
                type is entered in “TertiaryY” field. If the transformer has three windings, by checking “Three Winding”
                option, the third winding
                is added while if the transformer is single-phase, “1phase” option should be checked. In “Rating”
                section, the nominal value of voltages and the apparent power of the transformer are specified. Also, in
                “Voltage Rating” field, the primary

                corresponding fields in terms of
                KVA and percent, respectively. / / / / / The information regarding the tap changer of the transformer
                needs to be entered in “Tap Changer” section. The tap changer type is selected from among “OLTC On-Load
                Tap Changer” and “DETC De-Energized
                Tap Changer” in “Type” field. In “Winding” field, it is required to specify that at which side of the
                transformer winding is the tap changer located. In “No. of Taps” field, the number of taps of the tap
                changer are entered while in “Start
                Tap No.” it is specified that from what number the transformer taps to begin are. In the next step it is
                necessary to enter the voltage of every tap which can be done in multiple ways. / / In the first method
                if the distance between the
                taps of the transformer is equal, the first, middle and last voltages are entered in “First Voltage”,
                “Middle Voltage” and “Last Voltage” fields, respectively, so that the software can calculate the voltage
                in other taps. In some “Name
                Plates” of transformer, it may happen that only the middle tap voltage and the difference between the
                tap voltages are mentioned in percentage. In this case, the “Middle” option is selected and the middle
                tap deviation percentage as well
                as its voltage are entered in “Deviation” and “Middle Voltage” fields, respectively, and the software
                calculates the voltage of other taps automatically. If the difference between the taps is equal and
                voltages of the first and second
                taps are mentioned on the transformer plate, this option is selected and the voltage of “First Voltage”
                and “Second Voltage” fields are entered. In all of the mentioned cases the voltage of the taps are
                calculated and displayed in “Voltage
                Value” table. If the distance between the taps is not equal or the user wishes to enter the tap voltages
                manually, “Custom” option can be used. By selecting this option, “Voltage Value” table appears and you
                can manually enter the voltage
                for each tap. / / / / The tap changer type is specified in “Tap Control Setting” section. If you wish to
                control the taps manually you should select “Manual” option; otherwise, select “Automatic Tap Control”
                so that the taps are controlled
                automatically. If “Automatic Tap Control” is selected, “Tap Changing Setting” and “State Termination”
                sections are displayed. In “Tap Changing Setting” section, the settings related to tap changing is
                specified. In “Impulse” field the
                time during which the pulse is sent by the device binary to change the tap is specified. In fact,
                “Raise” or “Low” command is issued by the device to change the tap for 1 second. In “Time” field the
                stop time for each tap is specified
                which is a 10-second delay after the tap change command is issued during which the tap changes. In
                “State Termination” section, the ending style of every state to inject the voltage to the next tap is
                specified. If “By Time” is selected,
                the voltage injected in every tap is specified in accordance with the time selected in “Tap Changing
                Setting” section and after the time is passed, a pulse is sent to change the tap. By selecting “By
                Inprogress Contact” and using a contact
                and connecting it to the binary inputs of the device, by changing the binary input mode, “AMT105” device
                recognizes the tap change and regardless of the time entered for tap change, a pulse is sent to change
                the tap. In “No. of Analog
                Input” field, number of the binary used to detect the tap change is specified while in “Reverse” field,
                the primary state of the binary input is specified. By selecting “Wet”, inprogress contact is determined
                to be of the wet type and
                its voltage level is entered in front of it. By selecting “Dry” option, the contact is determined to be
                of the dry type. / / / The amount of allowed measurement tolerance to detect “Pass” and “Fail” of the
                test is entered in “Tolerance”
                section. In “Ratio dev.” Field, the allowed tolerance value for the measured phases is specified in
                terms of degree. In “Winding Material” field in “Temperature Correction” section, the material used in
                the windings is selected from among
                “Copper” and “Aluminum”. The current temperature of the winding of the transformer and the reference
                temperature for measuring the winding resistance are entered in “Winding Temp”, “Reference Temp.”
                fields, respectively, so that the resistance
                values measured are corrected in different temperatures. “Correction Factor” field is related to
                transformer correction factor K Factor and by changing “Winding Material”, “Winding Temp.” and
                “Reference Temp.” sections, this section changes
                automatically. / / Also, by pressing “Add to Report” option in the box at the bottom of the screen, this
                information is added to the output report and a message stating “The Report was added to the list” is
                displayed. It is possible to

            <Search>“VECTOR GROUP, TURNS RATIO AND NO LOAD” TAB In the device and the software provided by Vebko
                Company, turns ratio, vector group and no load current tests are performed simultaneously. To perform
                this test, the voltage is applied from high
                voltage side and the voltage of low voltage side is measured using binary inputs. In measuring the LV
                side, the voltage and its angle are measured at the same time. Also, to measure no load current, actual
                current of voltage outputs are
                used. To perform this test, first, the test method must be selected from among “LL” and “LN” from “Test
                Setting” section in field “Test Method”. In fact these methods determine the type of voltage applied to
                the primary; in “LL” the voltage
                applied is three phase while in “LN” the voltage is applied in form of phase to null or coil to coil.
                Note that in both of these methods, the secondary voltage measurement is done in coil to coil form. In
                “Direction” section, the direction
                of the conversion ratio test is specified; the conversion ratio test direction for a three-coil
                transformer is “Primary to Secondary” for a conversion ratio test between primary and secondary while it
                is “Primary to Tertiary” for a conversion
                ratio test between primary and tertiary. The test voltage is specified in “VLL” field while its
                corresponding phase voltage is specified in “VLE” field. In “Stage Time” section, the time of voltage
                application is specified; this time for
                “LL” method is the time of test while for “LN” method, this time equals the time of voltage application
                to each of the coils. / / / / / You can see two options of “Just Result” and “All Table” in “Add to
                Report” drop-down field. By selecting
                “Just Result”, only those parts of the table whose test has been performed are added to the report. But
                if “All Table” is selected, the whole test table is added to the report. / In “Read Input Voltage”
                field, the measurement method for
                the actual voltage applied from the device is specified which can be selected from among “Actual

                the number of “Taps” are adjusted.
                If you wish to insert all of the taps, you need to select “All Tap” and in “Sort Direction” field,
                specify that whether the taps are to be inserted from top to down or down to top by selecting “Up” or
                “Down”. If you wish to test a specific
                tap, you need to select “Specific Tap” and then enter the number of your intended tap. Also, if you wish
                to insert a specific number of taps, you need to select “In Range” and then specify your intended range.
                After specifying the mentioned
                information, by selecting “Insert Rows”, rows are inserted in the test table in accordance with the
                number of taps of the transformer. If you wish to insert a number of taps in a specific position in the
                table, you can use “Insert Position”
                section. For example, here taps number one and two are inserted above tap number one. / / / Performing a
                test for a transformer with off-load tap changer: to make a test file for a “Dyn11” transformer with
                three taps and “Offload” tap
                changer, “LL” should be selected as the “Test Method” and 50 volts line to line should be selected as
                the test voltage and “Up” should be selected as the “Sort Direction” for the taps. Then, by selecting
                “Insert Rows”, the test table is
                created. To perform the test, first, you need to adjust the wiring in accordance with the picture. In
                this wiring, the voltage resources are connected to the primary side of the transformer and to measure
                the voltage, the secondary of
                the transformer is connected to the inputs of the device according to the picture. Next, “Apply Test”
                must be selected after selecting the intended row in the software. Here, all three rows of a “Tap” are
                selected and then by pressing
                “Apply Test” the test is performed and the results are recorded. The results of this test are recorded
                in “I Prim. Meas.”, “V Sec. Meas.”, “TTR Act.”, “TTR Dev.”, “Phase Meas.” and “Phase Dev.” columns
                respectively. The mentioned parameters
                stand for no load current, the measured secondary voltage, the measured actual conversion ratio, the
                diversion of the conversion ratio from the specified value, the measured phase and its diversion from
                the actual value respectively. After
                performing the test, the results of the test are assessed in “Assessment” column based on the factors
                entered in “Tolerance” section. Considering these factors, the maximum allowed conversion ratio fault is
                0.5 percent and the maximum
                allowed phase diversion is 5 degrees; since the conversion ratio fault of phase number two is above the
                specified amount, the assessment of this row fails and the two other phases pass. It is possible to view
                the result for any of the
                phases categorized as “Turn Ratio Result”, “Vector Group Result” and “Current” by selecting its
                corresponding row. / / / / / / / / / Also in “Plot” section, the results of the test as well as the
                changes of the parameters measured in different
                taps are displayed in form of diagrams. In this section, “TTR”, “Ratio dev”, “V phase”, “Phase dev” and
                “No load Current” diagrams are displayed for every phase and it is possible to remove the diagram by
                unchecking it. / Performing the
                test for a transformer with “On Load” tap changer: There are three methods to perform a test for a
                transformer with “On Load” tap changer. “Manual” method: in this method, it is possible to select all
                rows of the table and then “Apply
                the Test”. After the test is finished for every tap, a message stating that “To Continue the Test, Press
                the Space Button” appears. In this case, you need to change the transformer tap manually and then
                continue the test by pressing the
                space button. This procedure continues until the last tap is tested. / “Automatic Tap Control, By time”
                method: in this method which has its own wiring, from the “Tap Changer” command panel, you should take
                two contacts of “Raise” and
                “Lower” to the binary out of the device in accordance with what can be seen in the wiring so that after
                testing every “Tap”, the command is applied to “Tap Changer” as long as the value specified in “Impulse”
                field and the “Tap” change
                operation begins. By applying the “Tap” change command, after the time specified in “Time” field, the
                next “Tap” test begins. This time is allocated for waiting for the “Tap Changer” to settle on the next
                “Tap” of the transformer. This
                procedure continues until the last “Tap” test is performed. In performing this test, just like the
                “Manual” method, “Apply Test” is selected after selecting all of the rows. After applying, the test
                begins automatically. / / “Automatic
                Tap Control, By Inprogress” method: this method has one more step of wiring than the previous method and
                in addition to time, it has the condition of contact reception. This means that, from the command panel,
                two contacts that indicate
                the state of “Tap Changer” should be brought to the input number 8 of the device so that if the “Tap”
                change occurs before the specified time, the next “Tap” test begins. In performing this test, like other
                methods, “Apply Test” is selected
                after selecting all of the rows. After applying the test, it begins automatically. / / /

        <contant id="Magnetic_Balance_Test">
            <Search>“MAGNETIC BALANCE” TAB The transformer magnetic flux test is performed in this tab. In this test,
                the voltage is applied to a voltage transformer coil and the voltage of other coils is measured and the
                flux division ratio between the two other
                coils is analyzed. Two important points for this test are that firstly magnetic balance test is not
                performed for single-phase transformers and secondly, this test can be performed on three-phase
                transformers only in the side where there
                is a grounded neutral. / Flux division test has three steps for every phase. In the first step, voltage
                is applied to coil #1 and voltages of the two other coils are measured. In the second step the second
                coil is short circuited and voltage
                is applied to the coil of phase #1 and voltages of the two ends of the third coil are measured. In the
                third step, the third coil is short circuited and by applying voltage to phase #1, voltages of the two
                ends of coil #2 are measured.
                These steps are repeated for the two other phases. Note that the voltage of the short circuited coil is
                zero and during all three steps, sum of the measured voltages of the two coils must equal the voltage
                applied to the first coil. If
                “Dev.” option is checked, the total difference between the two measured phases and the phase to which
                the voltage is applied is calculated and is displayed in “Dev%” field in terms of a percentage of the
                applied voltage. Also, if you wish
                to measure the voltage that occurs to the secondary side of the transformer during the test, you can use
                “W2” option. Note that if this option is checked, you need to do another step of wiring. / / / In “Test
                Setting” section, the settings
                related to the test is entered. Also, in “VLE Test” and “State Time”, the amount of voltage of the test
                and the test performance time of the test are entered, respectively. In “Display Values” it is specified
                that the test results are
                to be displayed as numerical values in terms of volt or as a percentage of the voltage of the test. If
                “Absolute” is selected, the applied voltage and the measured voltages of different taps are displayed in
                terms of volt while if “Relative”
                is selected, these voltages are displayed in terms of a percentage of the test voltage. / / The use of
                "Insert Mode" and "Insert Position" sections are exactly the same as those explained in conversion ratio
                test video. In “Magnetic Balance
                Result”, the results of the flux division test are displayed. This section is designed to help better
                analyze the test results. In this section, the voltage is injected from a phase and the voltage induced
                to the two ends of the coil is
                read by the inputs and displayed in this section. By checking “Insert Rows”, a row is added to the test
                table in accordance with the settings adjusted in “Total Result” and all the results of the test are
                displayed in a row. / / Performing
                the test and analyzing the results: “15” volts is specified to perform the test and after selecting
                “Insert Rows” and inserting the transformer “Taps”, the wiring needs to be done in accordance with the
                picture. In this wiring, you only
                need to connect the voltage outputs of the device to the transformer and the inputs of the device. To
                measure the voltage, open signal view before beginning the test so that you can view the voltage signal,
                “Actual Current” and the voltage
                measured by the binary inputs of the device during the test. By selecting the related row and pressing
                “Apply Test”, the necessary hardware and software changes are applied automatically and the test starts.
                Note that if “Start Test” option
                is selected instead of “Apply Test”, the test will not begin. / / / In the end after the test is
                finished, it is necessary to add the results of the evaluation to the report, which is done by selecting
                “Add to Report”. In addition, if
                you wish to add specific parts of the evaluation to the report, edit, or delete the report, you can use
                “Add to Report” cog. By clicking on this cog, you can see that the elements, which can be added to the
                report, are displayed with a
                checkmark and it is possible to uncheck any of them that you do not need in your report. Note that after
                finishing every test, the results are not added to the report automatically and it is a necessity to add
                the test results to the output
                report by pressing “Add to Report” before “Clearing the Test” and after performing a test. / In
                perfuming this test, it is vital to consider some points: the first point is that “Error Other” in
                performing the test means that there is
                a problem in connection of the wirings and the null point of the device is connected to its phase. The
                second point is that if “Error Power” appears during performing a test, it means that too much current
                is drawn from the voltage phases
                and you need to decrease the test voltage to resolve this issue. / / / /

        <contant id="Winding_Resistance_Tab">
            <Search>“WINDING RESISTANCE” TAB *One of the most common and important tests of transformers is the winding
                resistance test. In this test the amount of “DC” resistance or “Rmeas” is calculated by dividing the
                voltage measured through the binary inputs
                by the injected current. To perform this test, first, you need to specify the primary or secondary side
                among “HV” and “LV” in “Side” field. Note that, if the transformer has three windings, “TV” is added to
                the two mentioned options.
                Then, you need to specify the test time and current in “I Test” and “State Time” fields in “State
                Setting” section, respectively. Since transformers have a big self-inductance and core, in the beginning
                of DC injection, there is a huge
                difference between the actual current and the specified current and after some time, the actual current
                is equal to the specified time. This time is entered in the “Initiated Time” field. Due to the
                fluctuation in voltage and DC current
                during this time, the measured resistance has a lot of fluctuations. Since resistance measurement must
                happen in a situation with the least voltage and DC current fluctuations, the maximum allowed
                fluctuations of the impedance and the
                shortest time during which the measured impedance needs to fluctuate below the “Nominal Stability” value
                are specified in “Nominal Stability” and “Stable Time” fields, respectively. The current measurement
                mode is specified in “Current
                Measurement Mode” section and if the current is below 0.6 amps, “Analog Input” should be selected while
                if it is higher than 0.6 amps, “Actual Current” should be selected. / / / / *The voltage measurement
                mode is specified in “Voltage
                Measurement Mode”. Since the resistance measurement method divides voltage by the current, voltage Range
                of the binary inputs affects the measurement accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary to select one of the
                inputs of this section for
                measurement based on the winding resistance and the maximum resistance specified to each binary input.
                If the resistance is bigger than the specified range, the device shows an “Overvoltage” error, in which
                case, you need to either decrease
                the current or increase the resistance measurement range. Also, if you are facing an “Error Other” of
                the current outputs, you need to decrease the current. / / *The order and the position of the “Taps” of
                the transformers are specified
                in “Insert Mode” and “Insert Position” section. The mentioned section has already been explained in the
                video related to the test. Another one of the most important options of the software, which helps a lot
                in accelerating the test, is
                “Sort Mode”. Generally, for tap changer transformers it is suggested that this option is set at “Phase”;
                by doing so, it is possible to test all taps of a phase and then go to the next phase. But if “Tap No.”
                is selected, first you need
                to measure the resistance of all three phases and then change the tap. For example, suppose that your
                transformer has 21 taps. By setting “Sort Mode” at Phase and selecting “Insert Rows” you can see that
                the rows are arranged according
                to the selected phase which helps a lot to increase the speed of the test. After creating the table, you
                need to select the intended row and then adjust the wiring according to the guide picture and then run
                the test by pressing “Apply
                Test”. / / Running the Test and Analyzing the Results *To perform this test, for example, the “HV” side
                with three “Offload” taps and 0.5 amps of current is tested for all three taps. The settings related to
                time is left at its default
                and “Sort by” is set at “Phase” and then by pressing “Insert Rows”, the test table is created. The
                “Signal View” window is opened so that it is possible to view the current changes of the read voltage.
                To perform the test, the first row
                is selected, the wiring is adjusted in accordance with the guide picture. Then the first row is selected
                and test runs by pressing “Apply Test”. By running the test, the changes of the measured voltage as well
                as the injected current can
                be viewed. You can see that by changing the voltage and the current, the value of “Stability” changes as
                well and the test goes on until these changes reach below 1 percent. After the time test is finished,
                the actual voltage and current,
                “Stability” and the measured and corrected resistance according to the reference temperature are
                inserted in “Test Object”. To continue the test, two other rows are selected and the test is applied.
                Then, the wiring is adjusted for the
                next phase according to the guide picture and three rows are selected and the test is applied. After the
                test is finished, in “Plot” tab, the curve resistance change in different “Taps” and phases can be
                viewed. In the end, by pressing
                “Add to Report”, the results are added to the report. / / / / / / / / / **Some Points about Winding
                Resistance Test *Since these transformers have a huge self-inductance, injecting “DC” current causes
                huge voltage “Spikes” and the more
                the injected current, the bigger the created voltage. This voltage causes two problems: the first
                problem is “Error Overvoltage” of the inputs of the device; as you know, if the voltage of the input is
                more than 0.1 second bigger than
                the value specified for it, the device displays an error. Therefore, if the caused voltage “Spikes” have
                too long durations, the device may display an error. Another problem is the voltage that occurs to the
                “Mosfets” of the device. In
                case of injecting too big currents, this voltage damages the device. Therefore, we suggest to consider
                these points while injecting the current.

        <contant id="Leakage_Reactance">
            <Search>“LEAKAGE REACTANCE“ TAB This tab is used to calculate the transformer leakage reactance value. In
                fact, the short circuit voltage is the voltage applied to the primary coil while the secondary coil is
                short-circuited. In the short circuit
                voltage, the nominal current is established on both sides of the transformer. The active power absorbed
                in the short circuit voltage is the same as the transformer losses. The purpose of obtaining the value
                of the short circuit voltage
                is to calculate the transformer losses. As the load current increases, the short circuit voltage
                increases linearly. The short circuit voltage is obtained using the following equation. / In this
                formula, Ucc, Uccm, Ir, and Im are the values
                of the short circuit voltage in the Ir nominal current, the value of the short circuit voltage in the Im
                measuring current, the nominal current and the measured current, respectively. Now, to calculate UK%,
                the short circuit voltage calculated
                in the above formula is used in the following equations. / In the above equation, Ur is the transformer
                nominal voltage while ԑccm=UK%. It is necessary to observe some points in this test. To short circuit
                the secondary side, the cable
                size is calculated. Cable size or short circuit busbar on the secondary side are obtained using an
                example. Suppose There is a transformer with 7.5 MVA of nominal power, 33 to 11 KV conversion ratio with
                Dyn11 vector group and a %10 short-circuit
                voltage. The primary and secondary nominal current equal 131 Amp and 393 Amp, respectively. The CT turns
                ratio equals 800 to 5 amp on the secondary side and 150 to 50 amp on the primary side. Considering the
                conversion ratio on the primary
                side, the UK% value of the transformer equals 10 percent. Therefore, the short-circuit voltage is
                obtained to be 3300 volts which means that if 3300 volts are applied to the primary of the transformer,
                while the secondary is short-circuited,
                the nominal currents pass through the primary and secondary of the transformer. Assuming a 400 volts of
                voltage being applied to the primary of the passing currents, the primary and secondary are obtained
                using the following equation.
                / Taking into account the current value obtained in the secondary side, the cable cross section is
                selected in accordance with the passing of this current. If CT is present in the transformer, to avoid
                CT excitation, the secondary terminals
                are short-circuited. Also, this test is performed in the nominal tap and then the highest and lowest
                taps. It should be noted that to avoid sudden increase of the current during the test, the voltage is
                increased gradually. To do so, first,
                a “Continuous Ramp” state is created to avoid inrush current in the transformer. The measurement current
                must not be smaller than the nominal current but if this is not feasible, according to the IEEE Std
                C57.152™-2013 Revision of IEEE
                Std 62TM-1995, as much as 50 percent of the nominal current can be used instead. It should only be noted
                that if the secondary winding of a transformer is yn, the secondary neutral should not be connected to
                the other phases. In “State
                Settings”, the test voltage value and the test time are specified. If the transformer has several taps,
                “Insert Mode’ you can specify in which taps and in what order to add them to the test table. In “All
                Tap”, you can specify how the
                taps are arranged, from top to bottom or from bottom to top. In “Specific Tap”, you can select a
                specific tap; And in “In Range”, you can specify from one tap to a specific tap. “Insert Position” also
                specifies where the newly added test
                row should be above the selected row, below it, or after the last row. After performing the wiring shown
                in the figure, by clicking on “Insert Rows” for each phase, a new row is added, in front of each of
                which, the name of the phase and
                Uk and the nominal power of the transformer are written. These values come from the “Test Object” tab in
                “Power Ratings” section by default, but they can also be changed from inside the table. After performing
                the test, by clicking on
                the row of each phase, either in “Result Selected” section or inside the same row, the test results are
                displayed. In the fields “Iact”, “V meas” and “V phase” the amount of current drawn from the specified
                voltage phases, the actual value
                of the injected voltage and the injection voltage phase is specified, respectively. The short-circuit
                voltage and its deviation from the specified value which are displayed on the transformer plate are also
                specified in “Uk calc” and “Uk
                dev” fields. To execute this test, a transformer with Dyn11 vector group and a UK%=3.3% is used. First,
                the values are entered in Test Object and after configuring the wiring, by right-clicking on the table
                and clicking on Apply Test the
                test is executed and the test results for each phase can be viewed. Also, the waveform of the voltage
                injection and the current drawn from the transformer is displayed in Signal View.

            <Search>OVERCURRENT QUICK TEST ROOM On the Start page of the software, by clicking on „Overcurrent Quick
                Test“ from „Special Test“ subcategory,enter an environment that is used for overcurrent quick test.
                Generally, in this room it is possible to
                test the overcurrent elements in the shortest time possible by entering the essential settings yet this
                section is exclusively used to test relays that need a high burden such as electromechanical and disc
                relays whose pickup and drop-off
                is measured in accordance with the disc movement. wiring for this test can be viewed on the right side
                of the page. By default, it is possible to access „Report“, Signal View“, „Detail View“ and „Measurement
                View“ windows from the bar
                on the right side of the room; also, if necessary, it is possible to access the other windows by using
                the main menu of the software. After specifying the phase in „Inputs“ section, the amount of the current
                setting and the time are entered
                and the performance curve type is specified. Here CDG11 relay of GEC brand with 0.1 amp as the setting,
                0.2 as the performance time and normal inverse as the time characteristic is being tested. If the
                „Instantaneous“ unit of the relay
                is active, it is necessary to enter its amount of the current setting and performance time in Ins
                section. In ΔI it is possible to enter the start value of the injected current as well as the increase
                or decrease step of the current for
                Pickup and Drop-off tests. In this test, 95 milliamperes is specified as the start value for the
                injected current and 1 milliampere is entered as the increase step of the injection current. The reason
                behind designing this room is enabling
                the users to use shortcuts to manage and enhance test speed. By opening the Table View window, it is
                possible to view the created states. It should be noted that it is possible to adjust the change step of
                the current using – or + keys
                during the test. If the Up arrow key is pressed, the amount of the injected current increases in
                accordance with the specified step. By pressing ctrl+↑ combination key, it is possible to reset the
                amount of the injected current. In the
                end, by pressing Enter key, the obtained values are saved. Now view the actual value of the injected
                current in „Actual Current“ section. Also, in the result section, pickup and drop-off current values,
                tripping time in 2 and 4 times the
                pickup current and the instantaneous performance time along with the error value are recorded. Finally,
                after doing the test, it is necessary to add the results of the evaluation to the report which is done
                by selecting “Add to Report”.
                Also, if you wish to add specific parts of the evaluation to the report or delete or edit the report,
                you need to use “Add to Report” cog. By clicking on this cog, the items that can be added to the
                “Report” are displayed as checked checkboxes
                and if you wish any of them not to be added to the report, simply uncheck the intended checkbox. It
                should be noted that after doing the tests, the results are not automatically added to the report and
                after doing every test, it is necessary
                to manually add the results of the performed test to the report by pressing “Add to Report” before
                Clearing the test.

                Running the test and analyzing the results As an example, here an overvoltage function with 76 volts as
                the setting, and 4 seconds as the time setting in Micom P141 relay is tested. After applying the
                necessary settings in the relay, the
                configuration is specified as it can be seen. For this purpose, LEDs 1 and 4 of the relay are configured
                to show the pickup and the trip of this function, respectively. In the output contacts section, R4 is
                specified as the contact for
                recording the pickup. Moreover, R6 output contact in the relay is configured as a trip contact. To run
                the test, by opening a new window in „Over/Unver Voltage“ room and after entering the primary
                information such as the relay type, serial
                number, station name, feeder/be name and the manufacturer company, as an example, function OV is
                selected and the secondary voltage is set at 110 volts and OR is selected as the operation mode so that
                the results are recorded with pickup
                or trip of any of the phases. Since here there is no need for current injection, Enable Current option
                is not enabled. Also, since here open delta connection is not the case, Open Delta option is not
                selected either. In Data Table, stage
                1 is selected and the voltage setting is set at 76 volts the value specified in the relay and LN is
                selected in Voltage Type section. The time setting of the relay is 4 seconds which is entered in Time
                Setting section. Now by going to
                the State Setting in Testing section, Continuous Ramp option is selected. Here binary C2 and C1 are
                selected to record the pickup and drop and record the trip, respectively. Since the purpose of the
                overvoltage element test is to test
                all three phases, Fault Type option is set at L1E L2E L3E. 80 volts is entered In Vtest section which is
                bigger than the voltage specified in the relay settings and the relay must give a trip in this voltage.
                Also, by selecting Yes in
                “PU Test” and “DOU Test” section, pickup test and drop out will be done. In PU Val.Assess section, the
                approximate estimation of the value expected for the pickup which is 75.5 is entered. The test voltage
                start value and the final voltage
                value for the pickup test are specified in PU Start and PU End sections, respectively. DOU End is the
                final voltage value for ending the dropout test. The total time is entered in Total section. Now Init
                test button is pressed so that
                the states are created in „Table View“ in accordance with the entered information. After running the
                test, the results of the evaluation can be viewed in „Measurement View“ window, „Time Assessment“ and
                „Ramp Assessment“ tabs. In the end,
                after runing the test it is necesary to add the results to the report which is done by pressing „Add to
                Report“. Also, if you wish to add specific parts of the test to the report or delete or edit the report,
                you need to use “Add to Report”
                cog. By clicking on this cog, the items that can be added to the “Report” are displayed as checked
                checkboxes and if you wish any of them not to be added to the report, uncheck the intended checkbox. It
                should be noted that after doing
                the tests, the results are not automatically added to the report and after doing every test, it is
                necessary to manually add the results of the performed test to the output report by pressing “Add to
                Report” before Clearing the test.

        <contant id="AMT_AR_Room">
            <Search>AMT AR ROOM Various studies have shown that around 70 to 90 percent of the faults in overhead power
                lines are transient. At lower-level voltages such as distribution, there are fewer and about 80 percent
                transient faults while in higher-level
                voltages such as transmission, this value is about 90 percent. Thunder is one of the most common reasons
                for a fault to occur. The swinging of the wires or short-circuit of the grid with sundry objects is
                another cause for the occurrence
                of transient faults. Most faults can be solved by correctly using the trip process or reconnection so
                that the grid disconnection time reaches a minimum. To test any type of reclosers, its exclusive room
                which is AMT AR can be used. The
                main window of this room is Instrument AR. Also, it is possible to access other windows from the View
                menu or the bar on the right side of this page. To begin the test, first, the user needs to insert the
                functions that need the reconnection
                process to be examined for them into the Data Table. Therefore, it is possible to examine and assess the
                action or inaction of the AR for different functions. By clicking on “Add Cycle”, the next rows are
                added so that the reconnection
                is examined after the selected functions. After selecting the title of the function, the user only needs
                to enter the performance characteristic and its settings for the delay and instantaneous units. After
                that, the amount of the injected
                current and the fault angle are entered so that the time duration for different states is determined in
                accordance with the selected Curve. Dead Time and Reclaim Time are two other options that are used to
                speed up making the states. Finally,
                in the Expected section, the user needs to specify their expectation from the success or failure of the
                recloser after the action of the specified function. In the next step, the user needs to specify the
                necessary Binary Inputs and Binary
                Outputs in accordance with the elements required for the recloser test. It should be noted that for the
                convenience of the users, the important signals are available in the drop-down list by default. In this
                section, by selecting Add Row
                and Delete Row options, it is possible to add a row to add the binaries and delete the selected row,
                respectively. Considering the two types of the reclose test including laboratory testing simulation of
                the binary of the outputs by the
                test device and receiving the binaries by the device and testing in power stations receiving binary of
                the inputs by the device and presence of the binary outputs through the wiring post, some of the titles
                are common between the two lists
                of inputs and outputs. After selecting the number of the binary input and signal, it is possible to
                specify its influence on the current states including PreFault, Fault, Deadtime and Reclaim time. In
                other words, the condition for ending
                every state is determined by the binary inputs. In the next step, after selecting the number of the
                binary output and its signal, the user only needs to specify its condition for every state. This is most
                useful in cases where, for example,
                signals such as CB Ready or Close and Open are needed and testing the relay in the laboratory is
                intended. After adjusting the settings, by clicking on Init Test option, the states are created. These
                states can be viewed from Table View
                section. Also, it is possible to compare the different settings and elements of every state with more
                details in Detail View section. In this video, the AR function test for the MiCOM P139 relay is going to
                be performed. In this test,
                the recloser function is activated after the occurrence of the earth fault. To begin, the user needs to
                go to the settings section of the relay and set the parameters related to the functions. Here, in the
                subcategory number one of parameters,
                function DTOC is assigned to SEF protection. In IDMT1 section, the protections of OC and EF are of the
                delay type while in IDMT2 section, the protections of OC and EF are set at the instantaneous type. Now,
                by going to the ARC section,
                the settings related to the auto-recloser are adjusted. Here, the TDR option refers to recloser with
                time delay; Dead Time and Reclaim Time are set at 4 and 20 seconds, respectively, but it is also
                possible to activate the HSR which is
                the high-speed recloser. Next, the outputs are configured. Moreover, in INP section, the inputs needed
                for the assessment and the test are configured. By referring to the relay manual, it is possible to view
                an outline of the behavior
                of the P131 recloser function. In certain situations such as cases where there is a manual close,
                external signal, ARC function deactivation, and manual trip and protection deactivation, the recloser
                will be blocked. It is possible for
                the user to examine these signals in the AR room of the AMPro software. The user can begin the test
                after ensuring that the necessary conditions for the recloser to perform are met; these conditions
                include activating the protection, not
                blocking the ARC function, and being able to open and close the breaker and have the close state of the
                key. To adjust the relay wiring, the user can use the connection diagram from the manual. The user needs
                to go to the AMT AR room one
                more time and add the two functions of earth fault and overcurrent. It should be noted that in the first
                step, reconnection is tested for the earth fault function. This step must be passed successfully and
                receiving the close signal or
                the connection needs to happen as well. After specifying the settings related to this function in the
                first row, single-phase fault to earth is selected and Dead Time and Reclaim Time values are entered.
                Also, in the Expected section,
                the expectation from the act of reconnection is set at successful. In the next row, OC function is
                added. Similarly, the settings related to the delay and instantaneous stages as well as the fault
                current value, fault type, Deadtime value
                and Reclaim Time value are entered. In this section, we expect the act of reconnection to be
                unsuccessful. Now it is time to configure the input binaries. In this section, connection trip and pulse
                are selected from the list in this exact
                order. Here, trip is selected as the finisher element for the Fault state. It is also possible to select
                Close Pulse or Reclosure Successful as the finisher element for the Deadtime state. This should be noted
                that the “PreFault” state
                time is automatically longer than the “Reset Time” or “Reclaim Time”. In the binary outputs section,
                three signals of CB Close, CB Open and CB Healthy or AR Ready are added. Here it is possible to specify
                the status of every signal for
                different states ranging from “PreFault” to “Fault”, Dead Time”, and “Reclaim Time”. Finally, the
                “States” are created by clicking on “Init Test” option. The user can view the created states by opening
                the Table View window. After creating
                the states, it is possible to adjust the necessary settings for the assessment in the “Assessment”

                Yn-3ph/1ph” in “Object Type” section.
                / R=V/I If the single-phase or three-phase equipment which is to be tested is star point grounded, the
                first radio button should be selected and the wiring should be adjusted in accordance with the range of
                the injected current as well
                as the voltage level as can be seen in the figure. The equivalent circuit for this type of wiring is
                displayed as follows and the ohm resistance is calculated using the following relation: R=V/I / 2R=V/I
                For a three-phase equipment without
                a null point the second radio button should be selected and the wiring should be adjusted in accordance
                with the range of the injected current as well as the voltage level seen in the figure. The equivalent
                circuit for this type of wiring
                is displayed as follows and the ohm resistance is calculated using the following relation: 2R=V/I / In
                D-3ph method, the wiring is adjusted in accordance with the range of the injected current and the
                voltage level as can be seen in the
                figure. The equivalent circuit for this type of wiring is displayed as follows and the ohm resistance is
                calculated using the following relation: 2/3R=V/I / The voltage measurement mode is specified in
                “Voltage Measurement Mode”. Since
                the method used to measure the resistance is dividing the voltage difference by the current, “Range” of
                the “Inputs” voltage is effective in measuring the accuracy of resistance. Therefore, for measuring the
                resistance, one of the inputs
                of this section should be selected in accordance with the coil resistance and the maximum resistance
                specified for every “Input”. If the resistance is greater than the selected “Range”, the device shows an
                “Overvoltage” error. In this
                case, either the current must be decreased or the resistance measurement “Range” must be increased. In
                case of facing an “Error Other” of the current outputs, the current needs to be decreased. / Running the
                test and analyzing the results
                To begin the test, first in Test Object 200 milli ohm, 50 milil ohm, 10 amps, 1 second are specified as
                ohm resistance, upper and lower tolerance, current and test duration, respectively; also Input2 is
                selected “Analog Input Target”.
                Then, Object Type is set at “Yn-3ph/1ph” and“VoltageMeasurement Mode” is set at Up to 28V and since the
                approximate resistance is smaller than 200 milli ohm, Max Voltage is set at Up to 4.5V and then wiring
                is adjusted according to the
                figure. It should be noted that it is possible to magnify the figure by double-clicking on it. In this
                wiring, “lA1” and “lB1” current output phases are “Jumpered” and “lA2” and “lB2” phases are directly
                connected to the equipment. / /
                / / / / To measure the voltage difference, it is necessary to connect “Input2” to the test and further
                ahead of current injection connectors. It should be noted that before running the test it is necessary
                to click on “Init Test” so that
                the device “config” is adjusted automatically. By selecting this option, the settings related to current
                and test time as well as the hardware configurations related to “Hardware Configuration” including
                outputs of the device and “Binary/Analog
                Inputs” are adjusted automatically by the software. In “Analog Output” tab in “Hardware Configuration”
                section, you can see that the wiring of the device is set at “32A” with the maximum “Burden” of 400
                milli amps and “Binary/Analog Input”
                #2 are activated to measure the voltage. After performing the test, in “Signal View” it is possible to
                view the current waveform along with its “Actual” values and the measured voltage and also examine the
                connections of the connectors.
                / / / After the test is finished, the test results can be viewed in “Result” section. The results
                include “linj”, “Vmeas”, “Rmeas*C.F” and “Rdev” which refer to the amount of injected current, the
                measured voltage, the measured impedance
                and the difference between the nominal resistance and the resistance specified in “Rmeas*C.F” field,
                respectively. It should be noted that by holding the cursor on either of these two fields, the relations
                related to them are displayed.
                In the end, after the test is finished, it is necessary to add the evaluation results to the report
                which is done by selecting “Add To Report” in equipment test. / Also, if the user wishes to add specific
                parts of the evaluation to the
                report or edit the report, they need to use “Add to Report” cog. By clicking on this cog, the items that
                can be added to the “Report” are checked and the user can simply uncheck any of them which they do not
                need. It should be noted that
                the results are not automatically added to the report after each test when a test is performed it is
                necessary to add the test results to the output report by selecting “Add to Report” before “Clearing the
                Test”. Also, if one of the “Analog
                Outs” is faulty, the specified “Binary Out” should be changed; to do this, you must first click on "Init
                Test", then tick "Don't Change Hardware Setting" option and by going to the "Hardware Configuration"
                window, in the "Analog Out" tab,
                "Output Target" change the selected wiring according to the wiring. / / / Two notable points about
                performing this test are that „Error Other“ during a test indicates that there is a problem in
                connection of the wirings or the resistance
                is too high that the device unable to provide the required „Burden“ for current injection. Therefore, in
                cases of facing this error, examine the „Actual“ current value in „Signal View“. If the current is
                injected from the device „Actual
                Current“ but its difference with the specified current is too big it means that the resistance is too
                high while if the „Actual Current“ is zero, this means that the route current injection is open. In
                cases where the resistance is too
                high, the test current needs to be decreased while if the „Actual Current“ is zero, the connection of
                the connectors needs to be examined. The second important point is that the voltage read by the binaries
                of the device must have similar
                cycles. If the read values have a too big or zero tolerance, this means that the connectors are not
                properly connected. / / Since some users perform a “Megger” test for this equipment and they may need
                the results in a report, it is possible
                for them to enter their intended line and column in “Megger Test Report” tab and by selecting “Insert”,
                create their needed table and after inserting the test results and selecting “Add to Report”, add the
                information to the output report.
                Other options such as “Delete Report”, “Export” and “Import” are used to remove the information of this
                page from the report, exporting the output file only from the information of this page and importing it
                if necessary, respectively.
                Also, if the user wishes to set the characteristics of the created line and column as default for this
                section of the room, they can use “Set as Default” option. /

            <Search>THE COMPLETE MAIN SWITCHING The complete Main Switching, which is installed on switching number two,
                is the main part of the switching device. On this board, we have several modules including LAN-GPS, Wifi
                Module, Micro Module, Command Module,
                Fan Controller Module and Power Supply PS Module. In some cases, we face some problems where we have to
                replace one of these modules. Here we are going to explain how to replace a module. / If Wi-Fi
                connection has issue or more specifically
                we cannot connect to the device using the Wi-Fi and we have already performed all the tests and did not
                get any result, we need to replace the Wi-Fi module. When we substitute the Main Switching of two
                devices, we leave the Wi-Fi module
                as it is so that we do not have to reset the Wi-Fi settings. This part is what is meant by Wi-Fi module.
                This means that if we have a problem with the Wi-Fi and we want to swap the Wi-Fi of the two devices, we
                open this screw and swap
                only this module. This module is called Wi-Fi. / If there is a problem with the GPS module, in other
                words if we have a problem connect to the GPS or the LAN connection we can conclude the LAN-GPS module
                is not functioning properly, and
                we need to swap this module. To swap this module, first we need to open this spacer, then open this
                screw and then the LAN-GPS module is released. So, this is the Wi-Fi module and this is the LAN-GPS
                module. / / The micro module is the
                heart of the device. When we are performing different tests, there are some issues where we may conclude
                that the microprocessor of the device is not functioning properly and we need to swap it. There is no
                screw on the micro and it is
                connected to the board only by some pins. To detach the module, we release it from one side and then
                completely release it from the other side. This is how the micro module is detached. Reinstalling this
                module is as easy as it was to
                detach it. There are three pins at the bottom and five pins at the top, first we need to adjust them and
                then the pins with a higher number are installed. This is how this module is installed. / / Next is the
                “command” module in which
                we have the Overcurrent error of board number two. Whenever we face the Overcurrent error of the board
                number two, first we replace the “command” of the complete Main Switching side with the other side. The
                screw is opened like this and
                the module is detached and replaced with the command of the other side. After the replacement, we turn
                the device on using a series lamps. Then connect the relays of the device and connect to the device. If
                the Overcurrent error of board
                number two is eliminated, this means that the problem was with this “command” and it must be corrected.
                If the Overcurrent error of board two still remains, we need to examine the other parts which will be
                explained later. / / Fan controller
                module, in fact there are four fans in the device, two fans in the back panel, one fan on the heat sink
                and another one on the amplifier module which will be explained later. If any of these fans be it the
                heat sink fan or the fan on the
                back panel which is on the same side as the switching is not working, and there is no problem with the
                fan, then our conclusion is that the fan controller module is causing the problem and it needs to be
                replaced. The module is opened
                like this and then swapped with the other fan controller module and the problem is solved. / PS module,
                in fact the 12 volt power of the modules is provided from here. When the device is turned on and
                electricity enter the switching, there
                is no problem but the fans not working means that power is not reaching the micro and it has no reaction
                and only the power button is turned. In such cases, the problem may be with the PS module and it needs
                to be replaced. This module
                has four screws, two on the top side and two on the bottom side that are opened like this. / If the
                problem is caused by this module or in other words you do not have the 12-volt power, a test must be
                performed to see if the problem is
                with the upper Minmax or the lower one. Then, the faulty one is replaced with the spare module. This is
                one of the modules that are located on the Main switching and its function, how to move it and how to
                replace it have been already
                explained. Another point about PS module is that this module provides our switching set with two 12
                volts DC and 5 volts DC Minmaxes. If we want to test to see whether this module is providing us with the
                12 volt Minmax or the 5 volt Minmax,
                there is a set of Pin Headers using which we can check these values. / These six upper Pin Header are 12
                volts positive and these four lower pins are 5 volts positive and these eight pins in the middle with
                GND phrase written on them.
                This means that between measuring the voltage between GND and 12 volt we can make sure that the 12 volts
                is healthy and between GND and 5 volts we can check to see if the circuit is provided with the 5 volt
                voltage or not. If we do not
                have any of these, one of the 12 volt or 5 volt Minmaxes is definitely damaged. / /

        <contant id="Main_Switching_Error_Overcurrent_board1">
            <Search>MAIN SWITCHING ERROR OVERCURRENT BOARD In the incomplete Main Switching, there are two problems that
                can avoid the device from turning on and functioning. Sometimes the NTCs of these two parts and also
                their diodes burn out. However, these
                NTCs have been totally removed from the latest boards. In the old boards that have this part, if there
                is any problem with it, it can be easily replaced with a piece of wire it should be short-circuited.
                When this part burns out, the device
                will not turn on because it has no power and it either becomes open-circuited or explodes. Normally,
                this part has 11 ohm resistance which is a small amount. When this part burns out, its signs are totally
                obvious. This part must be detached
                as you can see and replaced with a piece of wire. This way the problem with the device is solved and we
                will not have the problem of the device not turning on. / / / / / Another topic is three pairs of
                diodes. In fact, these diodes are
                located between the earth and phase, earth and null and phase and null. Whenever the earth of the system
                we are using is electrified or its null and phase become one, one of these three pairs of diodes burns
                out. In this case if the earth
                of the device is connected and the device is turned on, the fuse of the device will definitely burn out
                or the fuse of the place from which the electricity is taken will trip. In such case, you can only use
                the device if the earth is not
                connected to the device and it works without earth. To solve this problem, the diodes must be replaced.
                It is so simple to test these diodes. First, remove the diode from the circuit and test it like this.
                The diode is open from one side
                and Overload from the other and all of the diodes are tested like this. Any of the diodes which is
                burned out, needs to be replaced with a similar diode with the similar voltage. And this topic which was
                about the earthing problem of the
                device ends here. In cases where the earth has a problem, these diodes are damaged and need to be
                repaired. / / There is one more notable point about overcurrent error of the board where if the problem
                is with the command, the command
                is opened like this and replaced with the command of the other side. Now, using a series lamp which will
                be explained later, we turn the device on. If the device is turned on and the switching of side one is
                activated and its relays are
                connected, if the problem is with the command and we have replaced it, then the overcurrent error of the
                board must be eliminated. / / / If the overcurrent error of the board number one still remains, the
                problem is not with the command
                and we have to move to the next stage.

            <Search>OVERCURRENT ERROR OF BOARD 2 PART 1 Now we are going to examine this error. The first point is to
                examine the “command” problem. By replacing the “command”, it is possible to find out if the “command”
                is healthy or not. We replace the “command”
                of this side with the “command” of the other side which we have detached before, take a test and turn
                the device on. If the overcurrent error of board 2 still remains, it means that the “command” is healthy
                and we need to check other possibilities;
                if the error is eliminated, the overcurrent error of board 2 is eliminated, it means that its command is
                damaged. Lets suppose that the overcurrent error of board 2 still remains as the command has be
                replaced. To do this need to open
                the Main Switching. Open the Main switching, open the two screws at the top, three in the middle and two
                screws on the end of the board. Then detach the Main switching. To test these items, test the diodes
                that are on the switching module.
                / The first diode is the one that is located on the transformer and to test this diode, It needs to be
                released it from one side because it is connected to the both sides of the transformer and if a diode
                test is performed it will show
                short-circuit and it won’t be able to find out whether the diode is healthy or not. Here there are three
                diodes to test. There are ten diodes here and two other diodes that are located at the voltage and
                current output. First, following
                the instructions that were given earlier, we detach one of the sides of the diode that is located on the
                two sides of the transformer. The diode test of this diode must show overload in the both sides this is
                a two-way diode and the result
                must be overload in the both sides. If the route of the voltage is displayed in one side, this diode is
                probably damaged. If the diode is overload in the both sides, it is healthy. If the diode is damaged,
                remove the diode from the circuit
                like this. Take the diode completely out of the circuit and if it is possible, replace it but if there
                isn’t a diode, we can just remove this damaged diode from the circuit and the device will be fine. / / /
                The next diodes that need to
                be tested are these three diodes. The first diode must show overload from one side and a value as big as
                0/8 from the other side. The second and third diodes are tested in the same way. If any of these diodes
                is damaged, we can just remove
                them from the circuit like we did with the diode that was on the both sides of the transformer and this
                will not cause any problem for the device. If we have a spare diode, we can replace it with the damaged
                part. The next diodes that
                need to be tested are these ten diodes that are located here. These diodes pass the current from one
                side and their other side is a closed route. z/ / / / / One notable point is that this diode belongs to
                the DC voltage output. If this
                diode is burned out, it shows us that this other two diodes are burned out. In the first stage, we need
                to remove this diode from the circuit and then test these two diodes. Usually these two are shown to be
                healthy. This means that this
                diode’s burning out causes the other two diodes to be showed as burned out. But when this diode is
                removed from the circuit, there is no sign of damage in these two diodes and they are healthy and this
                problem is solved by removing from
                the circuit. / These two here are the next diodes. We need to release them from one side like this and
                then perform a diode test like this. They should be overload from both sides; if they let the current
                pass from one side or show short-circuit
                then that diode is burned out and must be removed or replaced with a spare part if possible. /

        <contant id="Overcurrent_Error_Of_Board2_Part2">
            <Search>OVERCURRENT ERROR BOARD 2 PART2 IGBTs’ burning out can be another reason for an Overcurrent error of
                board number two. / Here there are four IGBTs which are numbered as IGBT1, 2, 3, and 4 and they are
                connected to each other two by two. IGBT
                1 is connected to IGBT 3 and IGBT 2 is connected to IGBT 4. In testing them if IGBT 1 is burned out,
                IGBT 3 will definitely be shown as burned out as well. In this case, it is possible that both of them
                are burned out or maybe only one
                of them is burned out. To detect the burned-out part, we need to remove one of the IGBTs from the
                circuit and test it outside the circuit. If it is healthy then the other one is burned out. But if the
                one outside the circuit is burned
                out, we test the other IGBT on the board and if it is healthy there is no problem but if it is not
                healthy then both IGBTs are burned out and need to be replaced. To test an IGBT, we need to test its
                three pins including gate, drain and
                source. Between drain and source, a diode test should be connected on one side and Overload from the
                other side. Diode test between gate and source pins and between gate and drain pins should be Overload
                on the both sides and if there
                is a short-circuit or a value, the IGBT has been damaged. Now we test the IGBT. First between drain the
                middle pin and source the right-side pin which is open from one side. The negative probe is connected to
                drain pin while the positive
                probe is connected to source pin. There is 0/48 value from one side and Overload from the other. Now we
                take gate with drain and source, they should be both Overload and the results does not change if the
                probes are swapped. There must
                no plan to any other pins from drain. This test is the same for all pins. / Now we suppose that one of
                these IGBTs is damaged which means that we have an Overcurrent problem of board number two. We tested
                the diodes and they are all healthy.
                So, our conclusion is that the problem must be with IGBTs. We tested the IGBTs and IGBT one and three
                have signs of being burned out. Now we need to find out which one is burned out and explain how to
                replace it. There is a holder on IGBTs
                one which has five screws. This holder attaches all IGBTs to the heat sink applying the same amount of
                pressure. To open it we need to open these five screws, and then the holder is released. Now we want to
                remove IGBT number one from
                the circuit. To do this we need a tool named desoldering suction. This too, in fact, removes the tin
                from the circuit so that we can easily release the pins. Now we hold the soldering iron on the first pin
                of the IGBT until the tin is
                completely melted, then using the desoldering suction, we remove the tin. We repeat this for the rest of
                the pins. If the tin is not completely removed, we can add some more tin and try removing the tin again.
                We turn the module upside
                down; by moving the IGBT we can easily remove it from the circuit. / / We test the IGBT one more time
                outside the circuit. The pins of the IGBT are gate, drain and source. There is a connection between
                drain and source from one side and
                the diode test shows a number but from the other side, when we swap the probes, it shows Overload.
                Between gate and drain and also gate and source there should be Overload. This means that there must not
                be any route between gate and drain,
                and gate and source. We test again, the drain middle pin and source show Overload from one side and a
                number from the other side. Also, gate and drain, and gate and source are also Overload. / Now, this
                IGBT is healthy; supposing that
                there is a problem with the device, if this is healthy then definitely IGBT number three is damaged and
                if we take a diode test, it must prove this theory. Since now all IGBTs are healthy, it is not possible
                to show this., Suppose that
                IGBT 1 was damaged and we replaced it and now we want to put it back in its place. Now we need to remove
                the extra tin on its pins using a soldering iron because extra tin does not let the pins cross inside
                the pads. There is an insulation
                named mica on every heat sink and beneath every IGBT. In fact, this insulation is used to prevent any
                connection between the body of this MOSFET and this heat sink which is located on the switching. / /
                Before putting the IGBT back in
                its place we need to check its pads and make sure that there is no tin left so that we can easily
                install the IGBT. If there is any tin left inside the pads, we need to remove it using the desoldering
                suction. The holes are opened like
                this and this is how we put the IGBT back in its place. , Then we put the insulation back in its place
                meticulously. It is necessary for the height of these IGBTs to be the same because to close the holder,
                they all must be at the same
                level and with the same amount of pressure. When the IGBT is adjusted, we put tin on one of the pins
                like this and make sure that it is flat. Now we put tin on the other pins to stabilize them. The tin
                must thoroughly cover the pins. The
                crack you can see here needs to be evenly filled with tin. / / / When the IGBTs are removed, there is
                metallized in these pads. After we remove the part, this metallized is damaged and rendered useless. In
                fact, the metallized is the connection
                between the upper and lower layer of the board. To solve this problem, we should tin-plate these pins
                from above. We put the tin here so that the connection between the upper pins and the upper pads is
                completely established, like this.
                After we ensure their connection, it is time to close the holder. To close the holder, we begin by
                fastening the middle screw. Then we put the holder back in its place and fasten the screw as long as it
                is reached its end but not completely
                fastened. Then we put the holder in a straight angle and fasten the other screws. The screws must be
                fastened following this exact order so that the pressure applied to the IGBTs to attach them to the heat
                sink is evenly distributed. /
                / Now we want to make sure that there is no body connection between the IGBT and heat sink. We set the
                multimeter at ohm mode. We take an IGBT test from the middle pin of IGBT and the heat sink should be
                Overload. Then we test all IGBTs
                following the same procedure to ensure that there is no connection. So here the replacement of the IGBT
                ends and now we can close the Main Switching and take a test to see whether the problem has been solved
                or not. /

            <Search>SWITCHING TROUBLESHOOTING Switching is composed of two parts switching one and switching two. This
                part on which the microprocessor is located on is in fact switching number two. Both sides have a Main
                Switching. The side which has a microprocessor
                is the Main Switching while the other side which has fewer modules is the incomplete Main Switching. / /
                / Now, let’s look at the Overcurrent error of board number one. The first thing we face in the
                Overcurrent error of board number one
                is “command”. After the Minmax burns out, the “command” is damaged which cause an Overcurrent error of
                the board number one. The easiest way to test it, is to replace the “command” of the complete wide with
                the one of the incomplete side
                and see if it is healthy or not. The next things that we can check are the IGBTs that are located on the
                switching. There are four IGBTs on which a diode test has to be performed to see if they are healthy
                This will be more explained later.
                Next are the diodes on the switching module that are located under the Main; since these diodes can
                cause an Overcurrent error of board number one, they need to be tested as well. To access these diodes,
                the Main of the incomplete Switching
                needs to be opened which is done by unscrewing seven screws. After unscrewing the screws, the Main is
                easily detached. There are some diodes on the Main which should be tested to examine the reason for the
                Overcurrent error of board number
                one. A diode has a transformer on each side. To test this diode, it is necessary that one of its ends is
                detached from the circuit because this diode is located at the two ends of the Trans and if we perform
                the test in this state, a short-circuit
                is displayed. Therefore, one of its ends must be detached. / / / / / / There are two diodes on this side
                and eight on the other side. Also, there are two diodes at the end of the voltage output of the
                currents. To perform the test one
                of the ends of these two diodes must be detached. The first two-end transformers is tested. First, one
                side of the diode is detached using a soldering iron and the multimeter is set at diode test mode. After
                testing the diode it can be
                see that the diode is on Overload diode from both sides. / Now it is time to test the next two diodes.
                Overload must be displayed from one of the sides and the value 0/7 must be displayed from the other
                side. In this case the diode is
                healthy and there is no need for replacing it. There are 8 other diodes showing 0/3 on one side and
                overload on the other. All diodes are tested in the same way. In the end, these two diodes located on
                each ends of the currents voltage
                Used for Supplying the current Mosfet are detached like this. One side is detached These diodes need to
                be overloaded from both sides. What is meant by both sides is that by moving the end of the probes in
                any side, it must have the Overload
                value. this way, the diode test ends. Now, if any of these diodes has a problem, the faulty part must be
                replaced with a one in accordance with its Part Number. But, the absence of some of these diodes do not
                cause any problem. This means
                that if this diode is not available, it is ok to detach it from the circuit. Such as the two-end
                transformer diode and these two diodes. But it is necessary for these eight diodes to be present in the
                circuit. Also, it is ok for these
                two diodes not to be present.

        <contant id="OC_Board_IGBT_TEST">
            <Search>OC BOARD IGBT TEST The next element that we are going to examine is the IGBT. It was mentioned
                earlier that there are four IGBTs. A diode test must be performed for the pins of these IGBTs. Every
                IGBT has three pins of gate, drain and source.
                The diode test is first performed between drain and source. If you look at the IGBT from this angle, the
                middle pin is drain and the right pin is source. The diode test between these pins is performed from
                positive to negative or from
                negative to positive. When the negative probe of the multimeter is placed on the drain pin and the
                positive side is placed on the source pin, the multimeter shows 4/8. If the probes are swapped, Overload
                must be displayed. The rest of
                the IGBTs are tested following the same procedure. In the first place, this indicates the health of the
                IGBT. Next, the gate pins are to be tested with drain and source which refer to the left side pin and
                the side pins, respectively.
                / In this state, we should have the Overload value between every one of the pins. In fact, there should
                not be any connection between the gate and drain and source pins. If there is a short-circuit between
                these pins, the IGBT is definitely
                burned out. These IGBTs are shared two by two. If we number the IGBTs as 1, 2 , 3 and 4, then IGBT 1 and
                3 and IGBT 3 and 4 are connected. When these IGBTs are damaged, if it is assumed that the first IGBT is
                burned out, if the third IGBT
                is tested it is displayed as burned out as well. This means that their pins are short-circuited. There
                are two cases here where one of the IGBTs is burned out and the other is being displayed as burned out.
                In this case, one of them is
                tested by being detached from the circuit. Or maybe both of them are burned out. It is the same for the
                second and fourth IGBTs. If they both display signs of being burned out in the diode test, one of them
                is detached from the circuit
                how to detach an IGBT is explained in the following and the test is performed. If this IGBT is healthy,
                then the other one is burned out, otherwise the other IGBT is tested as well. / To open the IGBT, first
                we need to open this holder.
                The holder has five screws. The middle screw, the two side screws and then the other screws are
                unscrewed respectively and the holder is opened. Now, as an example, IGBT number one is removed from the
                board. To do this, we need a desoldering
                suction to remove the tin from the pins of the IGBT. Then we heat the pin and after the tin is
                completely melted, we remove it using the desoldering suction. We can do this as many times as needed
                for every pin until the tin is completely
                removed. If the tin is not completely removed, we can add some tin and then melt all of the tin on the
                pin and remove it again. The IGBT is removed from the board simply by giving it a shake. Now we test the
                IGBT outside the circuit. We
                repeat the pins, gain, drain and source. Between drain and source we should have 4/8 from one side, 4/8
                inside the circuit and 4/5 outside the circuit. But between gate, drain and gate, the source must always
                have the Overload value. This
                IGBT here is healthy. / / / / To reinstall the IGBT, there is insulation beneath every IGBT just like
                this. In fact, this insulation prevents the MOSFET body and heat sink from touching each other. This
                insulation must be exactly beneath
                the IGBT and silicon paste is used beneath the insulation. We put the insulation beneath the IGBT like
                this and then put the IGBT on the heat sink and then remove its pins from the pads. But before this,
                first the IGBT pads must be emptied
                from any tin. To do this, we put some tin on the pads to melt all of the tin inside. Then we remove the
                tin using a desoldering suction. / We repeat this for the next pads. Then, we remove the tin on the
                basses of the IGBTs. First we need
                to clean the tip of the soldering iron and put some flux on the pins and collect the additional tin. We
                repeat this for the other pins. We put the insulation talc and then install the IGBT on its extra. We
                put the pins of the IGBT in the
                pads as much as it is at the same level as the others. / / Adjust the IGBT and the talc beneath it, so
                there must not be any connection between the heat sync and MOSFET. After installing the IGBT, correctly
                fill the middle pin with tin
                so that the connection is established. Then we repeat this for the other pins. Another important point
                when replacing the IGBT is that when remove the IGBT from the board, the pads may be damaged. In fact,
                the metalized that is inside
                these pads is separated. For this, put the tin on the pin from the top so that the connection with the
                board is thoroughly established. / / Then close the holder. To do so, first, fasten the middle screw
                because a piece of metal is putting
                pressure on the IGBTs and the screws must be fastened in a specific order so that this pressure is
                uniformly applied to all of the IGBTs. This is why you don’t completely fasten the screws. Only fasten
                them at the end. If you are using
                a torque wrench for fastening the screws, set the pressure on 2.5 newtons on meter and then fasten the
                screw. If you are using a screwdriver, keep fastening until you feel that the screw is tight enough. / /
                After closing the holder, to
                ensure that there is no connection, put the multimeter in the ohm mode and check the middle pin of every
                IGBT with the body of the heat sink. It must be Overload in all states. So replacing the IGBT ends here.

            <Search>INTRODUCING THE INTERNAL MODULES PART1 In this part, we are going to introduce internal modules of
                the Vebko relay tester device, the possible problems and how to solve them. After watching the video
                tutorial on how to open the device, you
                must have noticed that the device has three main modules, including the switching module, the amplifier
                module and the front panel of the device. First we are going to get familiar with the switching module
                which provides the second module
                or amplifier with the main power supply. After opening the device, to prevent facing any problems during
                the test, you can use a lamp series that we have placed in the route of the input electricity. The
                phoenix that you are seeing is
                placed after the series lamp and is connected to the input section of the switching module. The
                switching module has a main module that is located in the middle and has two complete and incomplete
                sides. The complete side is the side where
                there are more modules on the Main while the incomplete side has, in fact, more protective elements.
                There are four pins in the incomplete side two of which are located on the left side of the phase and
                the other two are located at the
                right side of the null. / / / We connect this phoenix to the two pins at the middle of these four pins
                which includes phase and null. When the input electricity enters the incomplete side it crosses a set of
                protective elements including
                varistor, line filter and protective diodes two of which are located between phase and null, two between
                phase and earth and two more between null and earth. The incomplete side has two outputs. This means
                that the electricity enters the
                two phase and null outputs after crossing the protective elements which is connected to the two sides of
                the main input of the device by two cables. Therefore, the two complete and incomplete sides must be
                electrified. This part of the
                output electricity is connected to the incomplete side and this cable is connected to the complete side.
                / / / Note that as soon as the electricity of the complete side is connected, the black header enters
                the Main Switching through this
                pin. When 220 volt electricity enters this section, it enters the PS or the input power supply through
                this phoenix. As soon as we electrify the two sides of the switching the middle module does not get
                electrified at all. When the connection
                command of the switch number one and two appear in the software, the middle module gets electrified.
                This means that the middle module is never electrified at the first moment and the electricity only
                enters the PS from this section. This
                PS has 12 and 5 volts DC outputs. Through this PS, the electricity enters other modules including fan
                controller, micro module and LAN-GPS module. After the electricity enters the PS, its outputs that are
                12 and 5 volts DC electrify the
                above modules. These 5 volts enters the micro and by this IC changes into 3/3 volts which provides the
                power supply of the micro. / / / / / After that we can apply the commands of the main parts of the
                device by the micro. One of these
                commands is the command to connect switch one and two in the software. So let us emphasize that after
                the input electricity crosses the protective circuits that are embedded into the incomplete side of the
                switching, the two sides of the
                output are electrified by its outputs which enters the complete side from here and the incomplete side
                from here. The main commands are issued by the micro. The input electricity enters from this part and
                the PS is electrified. Then its
                output reaches the above modules. So, we provided the power supply of the incomplete side from this part
                but the connection of the commands of the incomplete side micro establishes the connection between the
                complete and the incomplete
                switching sides by a flat cable that is embedded in this part. /

            <Search>INTRODUCEING INTERNAL MODULES PART2 When the device is electrified in this state, after the
                electricity passes the lamp series, it enters the incomplete Main Switching through this phoenix and
                crosses these protective elements. In the end,
                this Main has two 220-volt outputs and one of the outputs enters the complete switching side from this
                way and the other output enters the incomplete switching side through this phoenix. When the electricity
                reaches this part, it enters
                the PS through this black pin header. This PS receives the 220 volts AC and converts it to 5 volts and
                12 volts DC and provides the upper modules with power supply. These 5 volts enters the micro and is
                converted to 3/3 volts by this IC;
                using this 3/3 volts electricity micro LPC1788 which is the main micro of the device starts working. In
                this part where the phoenixes are electrified, the middle part of the device is not electrified yet and
                only the digital part of the
                device is electrified. Then it is ready to command the middle part of the switching by the micro. Above
                the phoenix there is a glass relay which belongs to the complete switching side and is known as switch
                number two in the software.
                On this side, this glass relay is the relay which activates by connecting switch number one in the
                software and electrifies this part of the switching. Here there is a series lamp in the circuit. When
                the switches activate, the lamp turns
                on for a moment and then it turns off. It is better that there is a series lamp series in the circuit
                because if current is drawn from a part of the circuit, this lamp is turned on. As soon as the device is
                electrified the digital part
                enters the micro by 5-volt and 12-volt PS and prepares the micro module for issuing the command. In this
                part, we enter the settings of the software and connect to the device by entering the IP. , In Hardware
                tab there are two sections
                of Enable Switch 1 and Enable Switch 2 and these are the relays that were explained.

            <Search>INTRODUCING INTERNAL MODULES PART3 In the settings section of the software, after entering the IP
                and connecting to the device, there are two sections of Enable Switch 1 and Enable Switch 2 in Hardware
                tab. By activating Switch number one
                and selecting Apply, this section which is related to the switching of the device activates. This glass
                relay here is connected and the input electricity which is connected to the phoenix through a cable,
                electrifies this part of the switching.
                By activating switching number two, this relay is connected and electrifies the middle part of the
                switching. Whenever there is a problem in the switching module, if you have a series lamp, it remains on
                the whole time and you can find
                the source of the problem by disconnecting the key. Note that if you do not have a series lamp, other
                parts of the device might get damaged in which case an Overcurrent error is displayed. In the output
                phoenixes section of the switching
                module, we can have the desired voltage for powering the amplifier module by connecting this relay. The
                notable point is that the command module is the upper voltage section, specially these pins that are out
                of it. There is no problem
                before the switches are connected, in other words, it does not have any dangerous voltage. But when the
                switch is connected, be sure not to touch the command module with bare hands. The other modules are safe
                to touch. Up to this point,
                after switches one and two are connected, we must have the desired voltages in the device. Generally,
                the two sides of the switching module are similar to each other. Here there are two 8-pin phoenixes and
                one 4-pin phoenix. 8-pin phoenixes
                are the outputs that power the current phases of the amplifier. Later more will be said about the
                amplifier module. The phoenix that is located on the outside section on the board must have 12 to 13
                volts in relation to the 4-pin phoenix
                while the phoenix on the inside of the board must have -12 to -13 volts in relation to the 4-pin
                phoenix. When switches one and two are active, set the multi-meter at DC mode and in measurement, you
                can even measure these two 8-pin phoenixes
                in relation to each other and the multi-meter must show a value from 22 to 24 volts. After activating
                switches number one and two in the software, you must measure the output voltages of the switching
                module. All pins of this 8-pin that
                is located on the outside section of the switching module are connected to each other and it must show
                12 volts of value in relation to this middle phoenix which is the earth. This 8-pin which is located on
                the inside section of the switching
                module, must should -12 volts of value in relation to this phoenix in the middle. If we measure two
                8-pin phoenixes in relation to each other, 22 to 24 volts of value must be displayed. This phoenix is
                the output of voltage. In general,
                the switching module has two outputs one of which is the output of these phoenixes and has 12 and 12
                volts of voltage. The output of this section of the module powers the amplifier. This phoenix is the
                second output whose output voltage
                is 300 and 300 volts. Next, we measure its value by using a cable. In this phoenix the earth middle pin
                and the side pins are 300 and 300 volts. These outputs that were just explained belong to the incomplete
                switching side. Also, in the
                complete switching side, this phoenix that is located on the outside of the switching, just like the
                incomplete switching, must have 12 volts of voltage in relation to the middle phoenix. This phoenix
                which is inside the switching has
                a 12 volt output in relation to the middle phoenix. In this part we measure two 8-pins in relation to
                each other and an approximate value of 23/3 volts is displayed. Therefore, the output of the switching
                module is correct and we only
                need to check some other items on the module. We turn the device off and introduce modules of the
                complete switching side one more time. The PS module that is responsible for powering other modules has
                12 volt and 5 volt outputs. This
                is the fan controller module which is also on the board of the amplifier and when temperature of the
                device rises, it increases or decreases the speed of the fans. This is the command module and this is
                the micro module which is responsible
                for the commands of different parts of the device. LAN-GPS and Wi-Fi modules are located at the top
                which are used to establish the connection between the software and the device through LAN, Wifi and
                GPS. After the device is turned on,
                we first connect to the device. By connecting the switches, for the complete switching side, 220-volt
                electricity enters the switching and passes through Diode Bridge and eventually generates 310 volts DC.
                At the same time, using the command,
                the micro generates 4 high-frequency pulses whose outputs are located in this section and enters the
                switching module through a set of pins located at the back of the Main. These high-frequency pulses are
                connected to the gates of these
                IGBTs while 300 volts of DC voltage is connected to the drain of these IGBTs. Finally, a high-frequency
                pulse with a DC amplitude of 300 volts, which is the output of these IGBTs, is taken from the sources
                and connected to the input of
                the transformer. So, the input of the transformer is a high-frequency pulse with a 300-volt range which
                comes from the input electricity and is converted to DC by the diode bridge. Considering the coil of a
                transformer, it produces the
                expected output voltage of the switching module in several 12-volt and 12-volt, 75-amp, 300-volt, and
                300-volt windings that do not have much current. The desired voltages are generated after passing
                through the rectifier diodes in DC.
                The intended voltages are converted to DC after passing through rectifier diodes. The input electricity
                of these two sides enters this section through this cable and the connection command of the relay of the
                incomplete switching side
                and its connections are adjusted from the complete side through this cable. If this cable is removed
                from its place or its connection with this part is not completely established, when the switching number
                one is connected, an Overcurrent
                error of board one is displayed which is not eliminated by Clearing it. Just the relay disconnects and
                reconnects so that this flat is correctly placed in its location. Another point is that the relays
                receive the command from here through
                the pin header of this section and then it enters the relay to stimulate its bobbin. It is the same in
                these parts. If this upper pin header is not correctly installed, the relay will not connect and to know
                when these relays connect,
                by activating the switches in the software you can hear a sound to ensure that the relays are connected
                and ultimately have the output voltage from the switching module.

            <Search>SWITCHING MODULE we are going to see how to work with the switching module. If in the switching
                module we have an Overcurrent error of the board one or board two, we have to open the board of the
                switching to find its problem. First, we disconnect
                the connection between the two sides of the switch, which is this flat, and then the input power cables
                that enter the two sides of the switch from the protection circuit. Then, we open the screws that are
                attaching the two sides of the
                Main to the Spacer. Every one of these modules, except for the micro module, is attached to the Main by
                these screws. The micro module is attached to the Main by its own pins. / / / You can easily detach PS,
                Fan Controller, Command and
                Micro modules from the Main by applying little pressure to the outside. To detach LAN-GPS, first, the
                above screws are opened and the Wi-Fi module is detached. Then, by opening this spacer and a screw in
                this part the LAN-GPS module is
                detached. There is one screw in the end which is in the back of the PS module and two more screws at the
                bottom of the module. After all side screws are opened, the Main can be easily detached. / / / / / / On
                the Incomplete Main Switching,
                other than these protective elements, there is a command which, just like the complete switching side,
                generates high-frequency pulses and the output of this module is 4 pulses. We can detach the Incomplete
                Main Switching by opening the
                screws around it. Also, it was already mentioned that in addition to the protective modules, there is a
                command module as well. The command used in the Complete Switching Side is no different from the one
                used in the Incomplete Switching
                Side. This was mentioned to note that when we have an Overcurrent error on a Switching side, before
                opening the Mains, we should swap the commands of the two sides to make sure that the problem is with
                the command module. If the error
                is eliminated the problem is with the command otherwise there is a problem in other parts. / / After
                opening the switching module, it is a little hard to differentiate between the complete and incomplete
                side. In the complete switching
                module side you can see a double pin header. The electricity is AC that reaches the PS module. Then the
                PS is electrified so that the other modules are electrified. There is no such pin header in the
                incomplete switching side. Only there
                is a 3-pin pin header which issues the connection command of the relay of the incomplete side or switch
                number one. In the complete side, we have the same triple pin-header which is used for the complete side
                switch or switch number two.
                Also, we have the phase and null that electrifies the PS. Therefore, the side where this double pin
                header is located is the AC electricity and because of this, we know that this is the complete side of
                the device. When there is an Overcurrent
                error of board two or board one, as mentioned before, first we swap the command modules of the two
                sides. If the problem is solved, the command module is causing the error, otherwise, we need to open the
                Main as already mentioned and then
                move the faulty side up to this level like this. Here you can check some items to see what part is
                causing the Overcurrent error. / / /

        <contant id="Possible_Errors_In_Swithcing_Module">
            <Search>POSSIBLE ERRORS IN THE SWITCHING MODULE Overcurrent error of board one and two is one of the most
                common errors in the switching module. After making sure that the command module is healthy, in the
                switching module, we need to find the problem
                in accordance with the error that we are having on a side. As mentioned earlier, the input electricity
                enters from this section. When switch number two is connected, it is converted to DC by the diode bridge
                and 300 volts DC enters these
                two lines. It enters the IGBT from here. If you pay careful attention to the complete Main Switching,
                you can see that these female pin headers are connected to this part. These connections enter the
                command module from here. / / / / /
                This means that the command pulses enter this part from here and then go to the IGBTs. Each of these
                pins is connected to one of these IGBT pins. Some of the problems that some users might face are that
                when the IGBTs are placed on the
                board, while installing them in this section, the pads may be detached, or if the tin of these bases is
                weak, the connection between this IGBT base and the pin header may not be established. So the first step
                is to examine the command
                and after making sure that the command is healthy, we enter the switching module. First we perform the
                IGBTs’ test. We set the multimeter at diode test mode. The second and third bases from the top for every
                IGBT are drain and source bases.
                We connect the negative and positive probes of the multimeter to the second and third bases,
                respectively, and the approximate value of 0/4 must be displayed and in the opposite state is Overload.
                We perform the test for every one of these
                IGBTs. / / / / So examining the command is the first step and then we need to test the IGBTs to see if
                one of them is burned out. If drain and source has a 0/4 value and its opposite state is open or is not
                Overload and if gate and source
                bases are open, that IGBT is burned out. So far we know that the IGBTs are healthy. We set the
                multi-meter at Buzzer mode and check the connection between these IGBTs and these pin that connect the
                command and the switching module. From
                the top, the gate and source of the first IGBT must be connected to pins number one and two,
                respectively. The connection between this pin and here is a track from inside the switching module. When
                the IGBT is changed, it is possible that
                this track is disconnected or it does not have any tin and the connection is not properly established. /
                / Then, the second IGBT and its source are connected to pin number 3 and pin number 4, respectively. The
                source of the third IGBT
                is connected to the last three pins and for the fourth IGBT, the second base which is its gate and its
                source is connected to the last three pins. If all of the connections are correct, the IGBTs and their
                connection to the command module
                are completely healthy. In the end, we precede one more step and if we still are not able to eradicate
                the Overcurrent error, there is one more thing that we can do which will be explained in the following.
                There is a set of protection
                diodes in the input and output of the transformer so that they can neutralize any sudden voltage and
                also there are two protection diodes in the current output. We can examine these diodes by a diode test.
                This diode that is located at
                the two ends of this transformer, since it is located at the two ends of a coil and normally, these two
                ends are connected to each other, by testing it we can see that the two ends are connected so the only
                way to test this diode is to
                remove one diode base from the circuit and then test it. / / / / /

            <Search>CHECKING THE PARTS,IN SWITCHING MODULE ERRORS PART1 To test this diode, first, we need to detach one
                of its bases from the board and perform a diode test on it. In this test, the diode must be Overload on
                both sides. Then we test the other
                three diodes. This diode which is in a vertical position, if positive and negative probes are connected
                to its top and bottom, 0/4 is displayed and by reversing the probes, it must be Overload. This does not
                mean that these diodes are
                usually like this. All diodes are similar and do not allow anything to pass from any direction. It is
                because of the elements with which they are made parallel or series that these values are displayed. In
                fact, the correct value is 0/7
                that you can see and its opposite is Overload. It is the same for the next diode. We can test these two
                diodes by detaching one of the bases. The top side of these two diodes must be Overload as well. In the
                end to eradicate the Main Switching
                error, if the problem is not with the command, IGBTs and the connections with the pins, then it can be
                said that the problem is with the diodes. This error can have several reasons at the same time; for
                example, maybe the IGBT and diode
                are both burned out. In the first step, we replace the IGBT but the error still persists. It is better
                to test all elements and then turn the device on. Another solution is to check these rectifier diodes
                located at the transformer output.
                Ten rectifier diodes are located in the output of the transformer on the complete switching side. It is
                possible that these diodes are faulty and we are going to test them. So you can easily determine that
                which part of the switching is
                not functioning properly. Here there is a track and by removing the tin on this track, its connection is
                severed. By disconnecting this track, the connection between the input of the transformer which is these
                IGBTs in the bottom side
                and the top side of the switching is severed. Then we connect the switch to see whether the error is
                gone or not. If this track is severed, only the bottom side of the switching is active and the top side
                is completely disconnected. If
                you are facing this error again, it is obvious that the problem is not with the top side of the circuit
                and IGBTs, command and the connections of pins must be tested. More on the Overcurrent error First, we
                connect the electricity while
                the series lamp is in the track of the input electricity. It was mentioned that there are some
                protection diodes in the input and output of the transformer. We simulated the input of the transformer
                and our assumption is that the protection
                diode is burned out. Then we short-circuit it and by connecting switch number two, the lamp series which
                is located in the track of the input electricity stays on and disconnects the system completely. This is
                a sign of the Overcurrent
                error of board number two and we need to find the problem which is the diode that we short-circuited.
                You can see that when the switch is connected, the lamp series turns on and disconnects the electricity.
                By disconnecting the series
                lamp in the track of the electricity and by connecting the switch, you can see the Overcurrent error of
                board number two. When the device is assembled, there is no lamp series in the electricity track and we
                see Overcurrent error of boards
                one and two. If the device is open and if the lamp series is in the circuit, we can easily find the
                problem at any stage.

            <Search>CHECKING THE PARTS,IN SWITCHING MODULE ERRORS PART2 Now, to solve the Overcurrent error that we
                caused on purpose, using a short piece of wire, we short-circuit the diode which is located in the input
                of the transformer and suppose that the
                diode is burned out and we are not aware of this problem. In the first step, we replace the command of
                the incomplete switching side with the command of the complete switching side. But the error still
                persists. So, it is not the command
                that is causing the problem. Therefore, as previously mentioned, we open the screws of the Main
                Switching. We completely detach the main from the module, and then examine the IGBTs and their
                connections with the pins that are connected
                to the command. Finally, we get to the test of protection diodes. We cannot test this protection diode
                which is located in the input of the transformer, while it is still connected to the switching module
                because it is located on the two
                ends of a coil while that coil is short-circuited as well. Therefore, we need to detach one of its bases
                from the circuit and test it. We replace this wire here which is the burned out diode and is causing the
                error with a healthy diode.
                Then we connect to the software and the error must be gone. We have explained how to test these diodes
                before. To test any of them, first, we detach one of the bases and then test the diode. It is the same
                for these rectifier diodes. Every
                one of them must show 0/3 or 0/4 as value for one side, and Overcurrent for the opposite side. Note that
                to test these diodes; it is necessary for one of the bases of the above diodes to be detached because if
                this diode is short-circuited,
                when connected, we may see them as burned out while they are in fact healthy. We install the healthy
                protection diode in the input of the transformer again. Then, we connect the complete and incomplete
                Main Switching’s, connection flat
                of the complete side to the incomplete side and the input electricity of the modules. Finally, we
                connect the input electricity of the incomplete switching side and the commands. After replacing the
                diode of the input of the transformer
                and adding a lamp series to the circuit, we connect to the software and connect switch number two whose
                diode we just changed. Now we can see that the lamp series are turned on for a moment and turned off.
                All items are healthy and the
                output voltage is flowing. Suppose that we have an Overcurrent error problem of board number one. In
                this case, first, we replace the command of the incomplete side with the command of the complete side.
                If the problem still persists,
                we need to detach the Main Switching of the incomplete side. First, we disconnect the electricity cables
                from the two sides and the connection flat; after opening the screws, we remove the Main from its place.
                Then we perform a test for
                IGBTs and their connection with these pins. Next, we test the protection diodes as well as these two
                diodes and the rectifier diodes, just like how we tested the other side.

            <Search>CHECKING THE PARTS,IN SWITCHING MODULE ERRORS PART3 In the switching module, when switch number two
                is connected, we get an Overcurrent error of board two. According to our previous explanations, we need
                to proceed step by step to find the
                problem. In the first step, we replace the command module with the command of the incomplete side to see
                whether the command is causing the problem or not. Before doing this, we need to turn the device off.
                Then we replace the modules.
                Since we have already connected switch number two, it does not really matter if we connect the command
                of the incomplete side because we cannot activate switch number one. Then we turn the device on and
                connect to it. You can see that
                even by replacing the commands, the error still persists. We turn the device off again and open the Main
                Switching of the complete side. As mentioned before, we open all screws of the modules and then Main and
                completely detach the Main
                from the module. Then we test the IGBTs. To do this, we set the multimeter at diode test mode and test
                the IGBTs one by one, as explained before. Bases two and three must show the value of 0/4 in one side in
                the diode test and it must
                be Overloaded in the other side. Most probably the IGBTs are damaged because all of the four IGBTs are
                damaged in the test and to make sure of this, we need to remove the IGBTs from the circuit and repeat
                the test. To remove these IGBTs,
                we detach the Incomplete Main Switching so that the switching module is easily put on the desk. These
                IGBTs must be tested one by one. On these IGBTs, there is a holder that is tightened on the body of the
                heat sink by five screws. Before
                melting the tin of the bases of the IGBT, we need to open these screws and detach the heat sink a little
                and put these insulations that are located between the IGBT and the heat sink on the body of the heat
                sink. Then, by adding the extra
                tin on the bases of the IGBT and holding the soldering iron at this point, remove the IGBT from the
                module. Then we test it and we can see that this IGBT is short-circuited. Then we test the next IGBT on
                the board and this one is short-circuited
                as well. So we remove it and test it again which does not change the result and it is still
                short-circuited. Usually, in over voltages that are applied, it is possible that all of the IGBTs get
                damaged, and here only the IGBT number four
                is healthy and the rest are damaged. Then we assembled the healthy IGBTs on the board. When we removed
                the IGBTs from the circuit, inside the pads got filled with tin. Using a desoldering suction, we remove
                the tin inside them so that
                we can easily install the parts. By holding the soldering iron on the pad, its tin melts down and then
                we can easily remove it using the desoldering suction. Then, after removing the tin, we install the
                healthy IGBT until the last part
                like this and then we fix it by adding some tin. Following the same procedure, we remove the tin from
                the pad of the next IGBT and install the part in its place. After replacing the damaged IGBTs, as you
                can see, we emptied the pads, installed
                the IGBTs and then filled the bases with tin. In the end, we fix the holder that is placed over the
                IGBTs. After fixing the holder, we need to take a IGBTs connection test drain base with the body of the
                heat sink which is the same as
                the ohm test where none of them has body connection. Finally, we put the incomplete Main Switching and
                along with its command module and the complete Main Switching in their places. Then we connect the
                connection flats and electricity
                cable of every part. By turning the device on and activating switch number two and clearing the error,
                the series lamp turns on for a moment and then turns off which means that there is no problem. After
                that, we check the output voltage
                of the side that had an issue. Then we take a test between the eight-pin external phoenix and the
                eight-pin internal phoenix which should give 23 to 24 volts as the result. So the problem with this
                module was that three of the IGBTs on
                the switching module were burned out and by replacing them, the problem was solved and the output
                voltage is correct.

            <Search>THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE SWITCHING MODULE AND THE AMPLIFIER In the beginning, it was mentioned
                that the switching module is responsible for supplying power for the amplifier module. Two flats are
                used to establish the connection between
                the command of the micro and the amplifier module. In this section, the connection between the complete
                Main Switching and the front panel is established through this IDC. First, we explain the connections
                between the switching module
                and the amplifier. The switching module must supply the amplifier module with power through the output
                voltages. In this section of the switching module, the external eight-pin phoenix has 12 volts, the
                phoenix in the middle of the GND
                and the next phoenix have -12 volts that in these cables, blue is -12, black is earth and red is 12
                volts. These cables are responsible for supplying current phases of the amplifier with power. Before
                connecting it, we need to explain
                the amplifier module. The amplifier module, just like the switching module, consists of a middle section
                and two sides called incomplete and complete sides. There are differences between the complete and
                incomplete sides of the amplifier
                module. On the complete side, every one of these modules which is called controller, is related to a
                current or voltage phase and this controller at the top is related to the VL1 phase and the other is
                related to VL2 while the one at the
                bottom is related to VL3. By looking at the front panel, you can see that VL1, VL2 and VL3 are in
                accordance with the GND. The current phases are in this section. lA1, lA2 and lA3 that are connected to
                lA1, lA2 and lA3 front panel through
                phoenixes and cables in relation to earth. In the incomplete side of the amplifier, there are five
                phases. This is the DC output voltage which is located here in the front panel. This section is the
                output voltage of group B. here lB1,
                lB2 and lB3 in the front panel are connected to lB1, lB2 and lB3 in relation to earth. There is a
                difference between the incomplete and complete sides. As you can see, there are six phases in this
                section including three voltage phases
                and three current phases which have been explained before. On the incomplete side, there are five phases
                including one voltage phase of group B and one DC phase and three current phases of group B. Another
                difference is that on the complete
                side there is a fan controller module amplifier while there is no such thing on the incomplete side of
                this module. On the whole amplifier module, in addition to the main module which is the middle amplifier
                module, there are two mains
                on the two sides just like the switching module where the incomplete and complete sides are separated.
                In the amplifier module, after opening these screws we can separate these two mains and solve the
                problems of the module. Also, there
                are three sensors on every side of the module that are located on the output of the current phases. If
                we connect to the software, we can see the temperature of lA1, lA2 and lA3 sensors as well as lB1, lB2
                and lB3 sensors which is the
                same temperature as the room temperature. By drawing current from current phases, the temperature of
                these sensors rises. As soon as the temperature of the first sensor reaches 60 degrees, we get a Thermal
                error of the amplifier in the
                software. Now we connect the electricity that is being taken from the switching module side to the
                amplifier. If you place the amplifier in front of yourself like this, there are two phoenixes on the
                right side that are responsible for
                supplying VL1, VL2 and VL3 voltages and there are five phoenixes on the left side that are responsible
                for supplying lA1, lA2 and lA3 current phases. This black wire which comes from the power of the phoenix
                in the middle is connected
                to the phoenix number one on the left side at the top. Two red wires that carry a 12 volts DC, are
                connected to this section. Also, the blue wire carrying -12 volts is connected to these phoenixes. So,
                now we have connected the power of
                lA1, lA2 and lA3 current phases to the amplifier through the switching. In the next part, we connect the
                power of VL1, VL2 and VL3 voltage phases. As mentioned before, this phoenix here, the wire at the center
                of the GND and the left side
                of the red 300-volt wire and at the right side which is the blue -300-volt wire goes through
                resistances. We connect these two phoenixes to the power of the voltage phases. When we connect the
                switch, we must have 600 volts between the
                two ends of these phoenixes. So, in the first step, we took the power of current and voltage phases from
                the switching and connected it to the amplifier. As soon as switch number one is connected, the output
                of the voltages reaches here
                and enters the amplifier module through these cables. Also, from this part, a flat is connected to the
                amplifier module to connect the command of the micro and the SPI signals. Each of these two IDC Latches
                that are located on the right
                and left sides of the Main Switching module is related to one side of the amplifier module. If we
                connect this cable to this part, the commands will not be executed correctly. If by initializing the
                VL1, a Self Calibration error will appear.
                The electricity for the complete side of the amplifier must be taken from the right side of the Main
                Switching. By injecting voltage into this side of the module and testing it, we need to take the flat
                from the left side of the switching
                module. When the device is assembled, both sides of the device are electrified simultaneously and we
                connect the flat. Just note that the flat that is connected to the complete side of the amplifier must
                come from the right side of the
                Main Switching. So far, have connected power to current and voltage phases as well as the flat that
                establishes the connections. We turn the device on. Each of these controllers has a series of boot
                loaders that are put on the STM32 IC
                and when they are functioning properly, their LED blinks like this. When we connect to the software,
                usually we can see this earth error which appears if the related wire is not connected. We connect the
                earth wire and by clearing the
                error it disappears. Now, this part is electrified and the electricity reaches the amplifier module
                through these cables. By looking at the monitor, you can see four temperatures including Sensor
                Ia1=24˚c, Sensor Ia2=25˚c, Sensor Ia3=25˚c
                and Heatsink1 =25˚c. By detaching one of these sensors, for example, la1, an error is displayed in the
                software which can be cleared by selecting Clear Error. The sensor we just detached displays zero-degree
                temperature. By reconnecting
                the sensor, 24 degrees is displayed in the software again. To view the heat sink sensor, we first need
                to turn off the device. It was mentioned that there are three sensors on every side of the module which
                are related to the currents
                and two sensors are related to the heat sink. This part is the heat sink and the sensor is located in
                this part of the heat sink and is connected to the Main by this pin header. lb1, lb2 and lb3 and the
                sensor related to the heat sink
                number two are located in this part and connected to the Main by this pin header and its value is read
                by this Max1202 and displayed in the software. So, there are three sensors in this part and one sensor
                at the bottom and four more sensors
                in this part that are read by this Max. If current is drawn from any of these phases, these temperatures
                increase and as soon as the first temperature reaches 60 degrees a Thermal error of the amplifier will
                be displayed. Sometimes, any
                of these LN35s may have a problem in reading or this connection cable is damaged. This temperature
                displays, for example, Ia1 300 degrees as soon as the device is connected. This means that when the
                device is connected to the software,
                it displays an error because it has a temperature above 60 degrees and this error does not go away no
                matter how many times you clear the error unless the Thermal error is disabled in the software. But,
                even by doing this, some other problems
                may be caused. So, as soon as you notice this unusual temperature, you need to start looking for a
                solution to solve this problem. We connect the flat cable that transfers the commands. As you can see,
                the temperatures are as follows:
                Temperature Sensor Ia1=25˚c, Temperature Sensor Ia2=25˚c, Temperature Sensor Ia1=25˚c and Temperature
                Heatsink1 =25˚c. Also, Temperature Sensor Ib1=0˚c, Temperature Sensor Ib2=0˚c, Temperature Sensor
                Ib3=0˚c and Temperature Heatsink2 =0˚c
                which are related to this side and since the flat is not connected to this section yet, zero is
                displayed as their temperature. Now we turn the device off and connect the flat of the side of the
                incomplete temperature to check them. When
                we want to check the incomplete side of the amplifier module, we need to connect the left side of the
                flat from the switching. Then, we turn the device on and this time temperatures of lb1, lb2, lb3 and
                Heatsink2 must be displayed. So,
                if any of these temperatures is unusual and there is a Thermal error of the amplifier, we need to solve
                the problem considering the faulty sensor. Sometimes, temperatures of sensors one, two, three and four
                are all wrong. The tin of this
                IC which is related to reading temperatures may have a problem or the IC itself may be damaged. But if
                only one of the temperatures is being displayed wrongly, probably this IC is healthy and it is possible
                that the LV35 senor which can
                be seen easier by opening the modules, has a problem; also, it is possible that this cable which is
                connected from LN35 bases to this pin header has a problem. We turn the device off and turn the module
                toward the complete side. If you
                enter the amplifier in any current or voltage phase, every phase of Va1, Va2 and Va3 voltages has two
                MOSFET, N and P. Also, current phases l1a, la2 and la3, just like current voltages, have two MOSFET, N
                and P.

            <Search>GOOSE MESSAGING TESTING The new power systems, specifically power substations, are designed in such
                a way that protection and control schemes of IEC 61850 Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event or GOOSE
                are used in them. GOOSE messaging
                can be considered as a virtual connection replacing wiring and hardware connection. Hardware systems are
                physically checked and tested. -While GOOSE systems can be virtually checked. Improved GOOSE systems
                development needs enough information
                about VLAN Virtual Local-area networks, MAC address filtering and Logical Nodes. Moreover, it needs
                Ethernet traffic analysis or switch setting inspection. Testing devices can play a major role here to
                make GOOSE messaging testing and
                inspection easier. In AMT 105 devices, testing can be easily performed using SCD files in relays and
                network setting. GOOSE setting can be accessed through hardware configuration window. In this window, by
                selecting Import SCL option,
                you can import a created GOOSE configuration file. By choosing Clear SCL option entered data can be
                deleted so you can add another file. After importing the file, a list of GOOSE reference information,
                ID, MAC address, etc. are shown.
                By expanding each directory, you can see a series of GOOSE. If your selected option is put in relay's
                output list, while you want it in input list, you can simply choose Binary In option. Contrariwise, if
                the tester is supposed to excite
                the input of the relay, you can select Binary Out, after choosing the desired option. By choosing each
                option, related virtual Binary Input or Output will appear. After clicking on each binary, you will be
                directed to that page under Binary/Analog
                Input or Binary Output tab. Then you will be able to change the desired configurations. Therefore, the
                created virtual binaries will act like the real binaries of the device and will be considered in the
                test. Here is an example of the
                Goose testing for the Siemens 7SA522 relay with the IEC61850 protocol and the RJ45 port with the EN100
                card is done. Note that the selected IPs for the laptop network, tester and relay must be in the same
                range. The IP of the test device
                here is 192.168.1.57 and the IP of the computer network is set to 192.168.1.2. Now it is time to
                register an IP for the relay in the same range in Digsi 4 software. Here “192.168.1.4” is set as an
                example. Keep in mind that by having an
                MLFB relay, all you need to do is to create an IEC 61850 Station by registering the IP and initializing
                it. By right-clicking on the relay title and checking the Communication Parameters section, you can make
                sure that the VD address,
                Mirror VD, IP address and Subnet Mask are correct. Here in IED name, the title DIS stands for Distance.
                By opening the IEC61850 System Configurator, you can select the desired items from the Source Catalog
                and Destination Catalog sections
                and transfer them to the Goose Application section to perform Goose test. In this video, two protection
                items, Trip Zone 1 and Trip Zone 2, have been selected from the reference section. From the destination
                section, the Double position
                breaker item that was previously created in the Masking I / O relay is selected. Now all you need to do
                is to save the created file with an SCD extension. In the next step, open the AMT Sequencer room and
                Click on Hardware Configuration
                to go to the Goose Setting section and import the file saved in the previous step. As you can see, there
                are three items with subcategories in the Goose Control Reference section. By opening the subcategories,
                the function of zone 1 is
                set to Binary Input 11 and the function of zone 2 is set to Binary Input 12. In order to change the
                position of breaker in using a tester, Binary Output 5 is selected. The C1 binary is also wired to be
                used as a reference for comparing
                the time between trip zones 1 and 2. In the next step, you need to set the configurations for Binary
                Inputs. Here, Trip A and Trip B are selected to record the relay performance against Trip Zones 1 and 2,
                respectively. Then, it is time
                for Binary Output to be configured. Clicking OK will save the settings. Now it is time to do the test.
                As you can see, for trips in Zone 1 and Zone 2, in addition to the physically-wired contact C1, the trip
                is also recorded through contacts
                C11 and C12. You can also send a “change status” command to the relay, by enabling or disabling Binary
                Output. There are different ways to check the information transference through Goose. For example, you
                can use Goose Inspector, IEC
                Browser or a software like Wireshark.

        <contant id="End_to_End_Test">
            <Search>END-TO-END TEST One of the most essential tests to be performed on the lines that are protected by
                relays on both sides is an “End to End test”. To perform this test, both devices on the sides of the
                line must be synchronized and inject the
                required signals into the relays simultaneously. The first step is the stability test. There are two
                things to consider for this test: first, the transformation ratio of CTs and second, the polarity of
                CTs. For example, suppose that the
                transformation ratio of CT in post A is 1000/1 and in substation B is 800/1 and the polarity of both
                substations is toward object. If the current in the line is assumed to be 1000 amps, then the current of
                the relays of the substation
                A and substation B will be 1 and 1.25 amperes respectively. Also because the polarity of both CTs is
                toward object, there will be a 180 degree phase difference in the corresponding phases. The "AMT
                Sequencer" room is used for performing
                the stability test. In this room, 6 current phases must be activated. To do this, go to the "Hardware
                Configuration" page and deactivate the voltage phases. Then all the 6 current phases will be activated
                in the "Current Output Signal"
                section. Considering what was said in the preceding example, 3 balanced 1 amp phase current and three
                balanced 1/25 amp phase which have a 180 degree phase difference with their corresponding phase toward
                each other, will be entered in
                the "Table View" tab. / / / Injecting these currents into the relays will take 100 seconds. During this
                time, the "Idiff" of the relay, visible on the measurement panel in front of the relay, must be zero. /
                The second step is the characteristic
                curve test. In this room, first, the 'XRio" file of the differential relay which is being tested will be
                imported. To do this, go to the "Test Object" page and click on the "Import from list" option to open
                the "Template" list of the relays.
                For example, "7sd" is searched and its "Template" is selected. Then from the "File" menu, click on "Load
                Relay Setting" and the "XRio" of the relay of the post A which is exported from the "DIGSI" software is
                entered. A very important
                point to note in this section is that, also, the post B relay settings should be entered in the "XRio"
                of the post A relay. Because the curve of the differential of this relay is related to the settings of
                both relays, it is necessary
                that the settings of both relays are available in one file so that the curve is created correctly. To do
                this, open "XRio" from the subdirectory of "7sd" and then open "Additional Information". After that,
                select "Relay Parameter Section
                Remote Relay”. / / / / / In this section, in order to enter the information of the other side, the
                information on the parameters that are green in the "State" column, must be entered in the "XRio" of the
                relay. This information can be
                entered in two ways: if the file of the relay is available in the "DIGSI" software, the information is
                imported from the software. Otherwise, the other person in the post B should read this information from
                the relay and announce it. After
                entering the information, the characteristics of the curve of the relay will be created in the post A.
                The same steps are taken from the "Import from list" point to the end in the post B and in the
                "Additional information" section, the
                relay information of the Post A must be entered so that the curve is created in the Post B too. By
                double-clicking on the "Line Differential" option, the "Differential Protection Parameters" page opens.
                The point to note on this page is
                to enter the post A relay information in both posts A and B of the "Primary" Column and enter relay
                information of the post B in the "Secondary" column. It should also be noted that the information of
                "Protection Device" tab, "Idiff" section
                and also "Characteristic Definition" tab must be exactly the same on both sides. After the relay curve
                is made, the person on the side of the relay A must flow the 3 upper phases and short circuit the lower
                3 phases. Meanwhile, the person
                on the side of the relay B must flow the 3 lower phases and short circuit the 3 upper phases of the
                current. Once the curve is made and it has been made sure that everything is the same on both sides,
                such as the transformer's differential
                test and "Check" test, then the "Shot" and "Search" are performed. The point is that every test and
                "Fault Type" which is added to the test table on one side, must be exactly repeated, with the same
                values, on the other side in the "Fault
                Type". To perform this test, it is necessary to perform the test simultaneously on both sides. For this
                purpose, it is essential to connect the "GPS" antenna to the back of both devices first. Then go to the
                "Start-Condition Repetition"
                page and select "On GPS" option in the "Start Condition" tab. On this page, by activating the "Start
                Time" option, both devices show a specific time in the time field on their front. By doing this, both
                devices will, at the specified time,
                simultaneously start injecting the flow to run the test and recording the results.

            <Search>OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION FUNCTION TEST IN MICOM P141 RELAY “AMT Sequencer” is a module where all kinds
                of tests can be performed. It’s an ideal option for testing functions such as overvoltage and
                undervoltage by giving the user freedom to enter
                information related to various parameters, accurately and finally, creating the output in the way he
                wants. / With this introduction, in the following and in this module, the two foregoing functions are
                tested as an example in the MiCOM
                P141 relay by creating different states. Before starting, it’s helpful to mention a few points in order
                to advance the testing process properly: In the first step, it’s necessary to read the related settings
                of functions 59 and 27 from
                the relay. They’re maybe set in two or more stages. Also, a logic of the relay operation should be
                determined to specify as an example whether the relay operation is single-phase or more phases are
                involved in the measurement and, finally,
                the performance of the functions!? / In the next step, it’s not that bad to take a look at the relay
                configuration to determine what options are available to the user in order to display the Pickup-Dropoff
                and trips related to the mentioned
                functions. The record of the mentioned cases may be done through LED or contact. / In addition, elements
                that may block functions 59 and 27 are examined. For example, a “VTS” Voltage Transformer Supervision
                signal, or even a breaker status,
                can block voltage functions. Finally, keep in mind that elements such as “Current Supervision” can also
                affect the performance of voltage functions to include current values in these functions. All three can
                be displayed in the relay settings
                or its config file. To get started, just click on the “AMT Sequencer” on the software home screen to
                enter the test module. / Explanations of this module have already been presented in separate videos.
                Testing Overvoltage in “AMT Sequencer”
                The overvoltage protection function, as its title implies, checks the increase in voltage amplitude
                relative to the relay settings. Now imagine that in the relay, OR logic is used for this function so
                that if any of the phases become overvoltage,
                finally the opration signal appears and you can see the trip or hear alarm. Assuming a single-phase
                setting of 76 volts with a time of 4 seconds for the MiCOM P141 relay, the test preparation process
                begins. For these two parts, the settings
                and configuration of the relay can be displayed so that the user knows from which part these items are
                extracted. Note that the current group settings can be disabled in the "Hardware Configuration" section
                due to the “Current Supervision”
                function not being active and therefore no need to inject current into this relay. / Now name state 1
                “Prefault” to associate the natural state of the system. All you have to do is right-click on one of the
                cells containing the voltage
                value and select “Nominal Value” to retrieve the values from the “Test Object Parameters” already
                entered. In the next step, equalize the three voltage values. Use the "Normal" mode, since in this
                state, stable conditions are created and
                there is no change in the values of the injected voltage. You can specify the completion condition of
                this state on a time or by selecting the “Space Key Press” option, you can manage the test run time. /
                Now make the next state to create
                the pickup conditions of phase A. Since phase A pickup is considered in this state, it is recommended to
                use one of the two state types “Continuous Ramp” or “Step Ramp” to increase the voltage value of this
                phase. The difference between
                them has already been explained in previous videos, but briefly it can be said that in “Continuous Ramp”
                the values are constantly increasing or decreasing, but in “Step Ramp” the values are increased or
                decreased with the steps specified
                by the user. / “Step Ramp” is selected here. Double-clicking on “Detail View” tab brings you full-size
                windows in front. In “Start value”, a start voltage values of the state remains by default. Since the
                time characteristic is constant
                in this relay, it takes 4 seconds to show its performance, after each change of value, you need to wait
                even more. Therefore, "Step Time" is set to a time of more than 4 seconds, for example 4.5 seconds.
                Another solution is to change the
                time in the relay from 4 to 0 in order to test fast. This way, you can set “Step Time” to a less value,
                such as 200 milliseconds. / / In “Step Values”, an increasing step value of the voltage is specified.
                The smaller steps, the more accurate
                of pickup value, but the test takes long time. Since only the pickup of phase A is considered, an
                increasing step value is entered only for this phase. / In "Final Values", the final value is specified.
                Since the relay settings are 76
                volts, this value is set to a larger number, for example, 80 volts. / Keep in mind that by entering the
                number 80, you face a voltage limit error. So, just go to “Test Object” and increase the “Vmax” value in
                the “Device Settings” section.
                / / The “Triger” tab specifies under what conditions this state ends. If a definite LED is specified to
                record the relay pickup, you can select the “Space Key Press” option and press the space key while the
                LED is on. / By referring to
                PSL relay of the MiCOM P141, an LED is defined using a timer to turn on and off at the same time as pick
                up and drop off. If a particular contact is defined for the relay pick up, select “Use Binary Trigger
                Condition as Specified Below”
                to, for example, record the pick-up time by connecting the output of the relay contact to the default
                binary input C1. Here you can select the binary 0 to 1 as the end element of the state. / By referring
                to the PSL of a MiCOM P141 relay,
                a contact is assigned to the relay pickup. In the next step, perform the “Drop Off” process in the same
                way, but with a decreasing voltage. “Step Ramp” is selected here. A higher value set than the setting
                value in relay, for example,
                80 volts. Since this process is instantaneous, you can set “Step Time” to a low value such as 200
                milliseconds. In “Step Value”, enter the value of 200 mV, and in "Final Step, the nominal value remains
                the same. / / In "Triger", you can
                press space key as a drop off and the end of a state when the binary changes from 1 to 0. / The same
                pick-up and drop-down process on phase A can be followed for other phases, or a combination of two
                phases and three phases, depending
                on the mode of relay operation. The next step is recording the operation time. To do this, it is
                recommended first create the Prefault state to return the condition to normal again. The trigger of this
                state can be a specific time or pressing
                the space key as the user desires. Now in the final state, to measure the operating time, the “State
                Type” is used for phase A, with a voltage above the operating voltage. The state trigger can also be the
                trip contact of the relay, which
                is assigned to one of the binary inputs by default, or it can be recorded by pressing space key when it
                sees the relay LED. However, it is advised to use binary status change due to high accuracy. It is
                desirable that you create a prefault
                state after this state to complete the test. / At the end of the test, it is time to apply the settings
                to record values in the “Measurement View” window. First the name, ramp status, condition for ending the
                state, a checked signal, signal
                type, nominal value and tolerance are entered for the state in which the pick-up is recorded, i.e.,
                state 2. If the values are entered correctly, you see the recorded voltage value for the Phase A pickup
                in the “Act” column. Also, in the
                “Dev” the amount of error is recorded and a green circle is seen to confirm the test result or a red
                cross to fail in the “Assessment”. Follow this procedure for the state in which the drop off is set
                down. / Now you can record opration
                time assessments in “Time Assessment” tab. Enter here the states name, the conditions which are ignored
                in this test, the start and end conditions, the nominal value and the tolerance limit. In this tab, if
                all items are entered correctly,
                in the “T Act” column, you can see the execution time. Although, in the “T Dev”, the error value is
                specified, and in the “Assessment”, you make sure of the correct operation. / After this step, by
                selecting the Parameters menu and then
                clicking on Reports, you can select the changes you want from the Report Settings section and have the
                output as a file. / /

        <contant id="MICOMP141_UNDERVOLTAGE">
            <Search>UNDERVOLTAGE PROTECTION FUNCTION TEST IN MICOM P141 RELAY Voltage collapse occurs for various
                reasons such as increasing network load, decrease in phase voltage due to fault in the network, complete
                loss of bus voltage and similar cases. So,
                protection 27 is intended for different equipment. Suppose that in the MiCOM P141 relay, there is AND
                logic, through which the relay measures the phase-to-ground voltage and has a three-phase operation
                logic. The test preparation process
                will begin, provided that the setting at 51V phase to ground with a time of 4 seconds is provided for
                the relay. / First of all, take a look at the relay configuration during AMPro settings to be aware of
                the conditions that may have blocked
                an operation of the undervoltage function. For example, as you can see here, opening the breaker or
                disconnector blocks the undervoltage. / As another example, with online monitoring using “Monitor DDB
                Signals” feature, you also find that
                VTS blocks function 27 with AND logic when only one of the voltage phases is off. / Note that if no
                conditions has prevented its operation, by default, a tripping command is issued by it and therefore the
                tripping contact is active. For
                this reason, it is necessary to create state 1 by default with nominal values to get the relay out of it
                and ready to test. / Since the “Current Supervision” function is not active, there is no need to inject
                current in the relay, therefore
                deactivate the current outputs in “Hardware Configuration”. You can specify the end condition of this
                state on a time or pressing space key in order to manage time duration. Create the next state to make
                pickup conditions in three phases.
                Here you can select “Continuous Ramp” or “Step Ramp” in “State Type” to reduce three-phase voltage
                simultaneously. The difference between these two state types has already been explained in the following
                videos, but briefly it can be said
                that the values are steadily decreasing in “Continuous Ramp” and they decrease with the specific steps
                by the user in “Step Ramp”. The “Step Ramp” is selected here. / In “Start Value”, start voltage values
                of the state remain by default,
                but in order to speed up the test, you can select a value close to the operation settings. Since the
                constant time characteristic requires 4 seconds to display its performance, it is needed to make it and
                even a little more after each
                voltage change. Therefore, “Step Time” is set to more than 4 seconds, for example 4.5 seconds. Another
                solution is to change the amount of time in the relay from 4 seconds to 0 and perform the test faster.
                So, you can set the “Step Time”
                to a little value, such as 200 milliseconds. / / In “Step Values”, specify the value of the voltage
                reduction step. The smaller the steps, the more accurate the pickup value obtained, but it takes a long
                time. / Finally, the final value
                is specified in “Final Values”. Because the voltage is set to 50 volts in the relay setting, this value
                is set to a less value, for example, 45 volts. / Afterwards in “Trigger”, you should specify under what
                conditions this state ends.
                If a specific LED is determined to record the relay pickup, you can select “Space Key Press” option and
                press the space key while the LED is on. / By referring to the MiCOM relay PSL, it’s defined LED 1 with
                any start input to turn on
                if any element is picked up. At this stage, this option can be used to detect pickups. / Dealing with
                it, you can assign a contact to the relay pickup. In this case, you can select the “Use binary trigger
                condition as specified below”
                option in “Trigger”, for example, record the pickup time by connecting the output of the relay contact
                to the default binary input C1. In the next step, form the drop off process in the same way but with the
                process of increasing the voltage.
                The “Step Ramp” is also selected here. The start value is lower than the setting value, for example, 45
                volts. Keep in mind that depending on the moment of the drop off process, you can set “Step Time” to a
                low value such as 500 milliseconds.
                In “Step Value”, enter the value of 200 millivolt and in the “Final Step” section, the nominal value
                remains in force. / In “Trigger”, you can select the space key or changing a binary from 1 to 0 as a
                state termination of drop off state.
                Finally, the operating time is recorded. It is highly recommended to first create a state for prefault
                to return the condition to normal again. The state trigger is a “Time” or “Space Key Press” as you wish.
                Now in the final state, to
                measure the operating time, set the “State Type” to “Normal” mode with a voltage below the operating
                limit for three-phase. / This state trigger can also be the relay tripping contact, which is assigned to
                one of the binary inputs by default,
                or it can be recorded by pressing space when it sees the relay LED. However, due to the high accuracy,
                it is recommended to use binary status change. / At the end of the test, it’s time to apply the settings
                to record the values in the
                “Measurement View”. First enter the name, ramp status, state completion condition, signal to be checked,
                signal type, nominal value and tolerance for the state in which the pickup is registered, i.e., state 2.
                If the values are entered
                correctly, you will see the amount of voltage recorded for the three-phase pickup in the “Act” column.
                Also, in “Dev” the recorded error and in the “Assessment” section the green confirms the test result.
                Follow this for the state in which
                the drop off is recorded. / You can now record the operating time assessments in “Time Assessment”. Here
                you also enter the state name, states or conditions that should be ignored in this review, start and end
                conditions, nominal value
                and tolerance limit. In this section, if all the items are entered correctly, you can see the operating
                time in “T Act” column. Also, the error is specified in “T Dev” and you can make sure of the correct
                operation in the “Assessmen”.
                / After this step, by selecting “Parameters” and then clicking on “Reports”, you can select the elements
                that you want to display in “Report Settings” and have the output as a file. /

            <Search>DIRECTIONAL OVERCURRENT PROTECTION FUNCTION TEST IN MICOM P141 RELAY If a fault current is able to
                rotate on both sides in the relay protection zone, the directional overcurrent DOC is required to detect
                the direction, allowing it to trip
                or block depending on the situation. For this purpose, the relay uses a comparison of phase angle and
                fault current with reference values. In addition, RCA Relay Characteristic Angle is used to provide
                maximum sensitivity to performance
                in the relay protection zone. In the MiCOM P141 relay, the RCA value is in the range of -95 to +95
                degrees using the “I Char Angle” parameter. In general, the following formula is established in the
                mentioned relay: Directional forward
                -90° angleI - angleV - RCA 90° Directional reverse -90° angleI - angleV - RCA 90° The DOC function
                function 67 test is performed based on the settings of the first stage in setting group number 1. In
                “Setting” section and in the “Group
                1 Overcurrent” subset, the forward element is activated with a current of 1 amp and a time setting of
                250 milliseconds. Other current stages are disabled. It is possible to use the voltage transformer
                supervision VTS, to block DOC element.
                This is done in “IBlocking” cell so that if it’s set to 1, the VTS blocks the DOC function and if it’s
                set to zero, the stage becomes a non-directional function if the VTS function operates. Finally, it’s
                important to pay attention to
                the 45-degree characteristic in the current section. For example, to test the operation of phase A in
                the 1-amp mode, if element 35.24, the first stage of the directional overcurrent, is set to “Directional
                Fwd”, the current should flow
                out of terminal C2 but into C2 if set to “Directional Rev”. Note that terminals C3 and C2 are used for
                the 1-amp mode of phase A test and terminals C1 and C2 are used for the 5-amp mode of phase A test. If
                cell 35.52 V Deo OC Status isn’t
                in Disabled mode, there is an overcurrent function for operation mode with voltage control, or if the
                element of cell 3502, the first stage of overcurrent, is in “Directional Fwd” or “Directional Rev” mode,
                voltage input is required. For
                example, directional overcurrent testing on phase A, a nominal voltage is injected into terminals C20
                and C21. Before considering each case, it is checked which output and LED are used for the DOC
                protection function. Thus, Programmable
                Scheme Logic PSL is used. It’s possible that a specific contact is provided for the operation of each
                phase. Activating trigger which records error, is also checked for these two functions. If you want to
                manually test the overcurrent
                function without using “XRIO” or “CSV” files, just double-click on the “Overcurrent” block in “General
                Test Object” and select the directional in “Relay Parameters” tab, the relay’s setting is written in
                “Elements” tab. The characteristic
                angle is entered in “Define Element Directional Behavior” section. Note that RCA is in relay and to
                convert it to Maximum Torque Angle MTA, you need a 90 degree clockwise shift. In the first step of the
                test, at the best characteristic
                angle inject a current, twice as many as the current value is in cell 3503 into the relay and compare
                the operating time with what the software predicted. Continue this operation by injecting the quadruple
                current. You can also select
                the shot points to ensure that the relay doesn’t work in the blocking zone and follow this test at the
                angular boundaries of the directional characteristic. Note that for fixed and reverse time
                characteristics, a delay of 0.02 to 0.08
                seconds must be considered for the acceptable relay operating range, respectively. If you run the test
                on fault type L1, L2 and L3, the setting current should not act in a way that its reversal from the
                other two phases causes tripping.
                The next step is to enter the current and angle settings in “PickUp-DropOff”. You can use “Medium Detail
                View” to display the characteristic curve completely. By making settings in the “Trigger” tab, you can
                select contacts or other elements
                to record test results.

            <Search>DIRECTIONAL EARTH FAULT DEF PROTECTION FUNCTION TEST IN MICOM P141 RELAY If the earth fault current
                in the protected zone is able to rotate from both sides, it is necessary to use the DEF function so that
                the fault direction is specified.
                One of the common systems that require such protection is parallel feeders or ring networks. For earth
                fault standard protections, there are two options available for polarization including zero sequence or
                residual voltage and negative
                sequence. Here, zero sequence is used. Since at the creation time of earth fault, residual voltage is
                created, it is possible to use this element to polarize directional elements. This process is called
                zero sequence polarization, residual
                voltage polarization or Neutral Displacement Voltage Polarization. Since under normal conditions due to
                reasons such as imbalance, low precision of VT or equipment error, there may be small amounts of
                residual voltage, there is an option
                to specify the threshold for this element which can be seen as INVNPol set in relay settings. P141 relay
                receives this voltage from Residual Voltage input which is provided by open triangle connection or VT.
                Using IN2Char Angle parameter,
                the RCA value in MiCOM P141 relay is set at -95 to +95 degrees range. Generally, the following relation
                is established in the mentioned relay: Directional forward: -90° angleIN - angleVN + 180° - RCA 90°
                Directional reverse: -90° angleIN
                - angleVN + 180° - RCA 90° Directional earth fault function test or 67N function is executed based on
                the settings of the first stage in the number 1 settings group. Note that EF1 and EF2 functions can be
                activated in MiCOM P141 relays.
                In EF1, the measured current is used directly; also, current transformers or Residual Connection are
                used as well. In EF2 the residual current calculated from the sum of the three-phase currents is used.
                This is why EF2 is used. In Settings
                section, the activation state of this element is indicated by Standard Inverse curve in forward
                direction while the 200 mA setting is indicated by a 0/275 TMS. Also, a -60 degree performance angle is
                considered. In the end, the polarization
                voltage threshold is recorded to be 5 volts. It is possible to use the Voltage Transformer Supervision
                element VTS to block the performance of directional residual current element. This is done in
                IN2Blocking cell; if number 1 is selected,
                the VTS blocks the performance of directional residual current and if number zero is selected, in case
                of VTS performance, stage turns into a non-directional factor. Before considering any case, it is
                examined to see which output and LED
                are used for the performance of directional residual current protection. To do so, PSL or Programmable
                Scheme Logic is used. It is possible that a separate contact is considered for the performance of each
                phase. Also, fault trigger record
                activation is checked for this factor as well. If the user wishes to test a directional residual current
                function manually and without using XRIO or CSV files, they only need to double-click on Overcurrent
                element in General Test Object
                window and by selecting the directional element in Relay Parameters tab, enter the setting values in
                Elements tab. Residual section is used for this purpose. Also, in Define Element Directional Behavior
                section the operation angle is entered.
                Here, this angle is set at -60 degrees. In the first step of the test, a current twice the one specified
                in the settings section is injected into the relay in the best operation angle which is -60 degrees, and
                the operation time is compared
                to the time predicted by the software. This process can be continued by injecting 4 times the specified
                current. Also, some shots can be set to ensure inactivity of the relay in the blocking area and the test
                can be continued at the border
                of operation angles by adding new points. The next step is to enter the current setting and the angle in
                pickup and drop off section. To do this, Medium Detail View window can be used which gives a complete
                indication of the characteristic.
                The process of specifying Pickup and Drop off can be completed first for the current value and then the
                angle values. By specifying the settings in setting and trigger tabs, other contacts or elements can be
                selected to specify the test
                results.

        <contant id="New_End_to_End_Test">
            <Search>NEW END-TO-END TEST / End to End test is an approach used for protective schemes that consist of two
                or more relays that are in connection to exchange information related to trip and blocking. These
                schemes are used for more accurate detection
                of faults and faster isolation of the system. This test can be used to thoroughly analyze the protective
                scheme and make sure of its proper performance. In End to End tests, two or more test devices are used
                on each side to simulate the
                fault. To successfully perform an End to End test, the following elements are needed: - A test device on
                each side - A hardware piece to synchronize the two devices, like a GPS satellites. -A file that is
                exported from the relay software
                to be used in the test device. This file can be of CSV, XRIO, TEXT or other formats. A communication
                equipment such as a phone or a two-way radio to communicate with the other post With this introduction,
                we are going to analyze the software
                and hardware aspects of a longitudinal differential test on End to End platform. Hardware Preparation In
                hardware section, two test devices are needed for performing an End to End test. Each of these devices
                needs to be equipped with a
                GPS antenna. After examining the maps and isolating the piece of equipment for the test, the required
                inputs and outputs should be specified. For example, binary inputs AMT105 can be used to specify the
                pickup contact and trip. Binary
                outputs can be used in cases such as Circuit Breaker status simulation. In the next step, the test
                device voltage and current injection cables should be connected to the relay or test block to replace CT
                and PT for injecting the desired
                amounts. The GPS antenna is connected to the back of the device to use the GPS time as the base time. In
                End to End test, it is also possible to use other bases such as IRIG. To make sure that the breaker
                contact position is properly simulated
                by the test device, put the breakers in the right position. It should be noted that if other groups are
                working on the Circuit Breaker simultaneously, it is necessary to use the test plug to make sure that no
                trip is going to go on the
                Circuit Breaker. Software Preparation In software section, before anything, it is necessary to connect
                to the relay and save the setting and config files as well as the records submitted for event and
                disturbance somewhere safe so that
                if there is a problem, they can be used as a backup.In the next step, export the file needed to enter
                the test device from the relay. As mentioned before, this file can be of different formats such as CSV,
                TEXT, XRIO, etc. An example for
                End to End test to analyze longitudinal differential protection Old longitudinal differential relays
                used the ratio of differential current to restrain current and if this ratio was higher than the
                specified settings, the trip was issued
                while in modern differential protective relays, a characteristic named alfa plain is used. In this
                design, the vector ratio of remote current to local for every current phase and negative and zero
                sequence currents are used. Here, to better
                present the End to End test method, a longitudinal differential protective test is performed on 7sd610
                relays of Siemens Company. In this test, 7SD61 relays of Siemens with MLFB: 7SD61014BB990BJ0 and version
                4.77 frameware is used. In
                the first step, we are going to review the prerequisites for performing the test described above. After
                making sure that everything is ready, first Vebko AMPro software is run and after ensuring that the
                laptop is connected to the amp105,
                the device IP is entered and the connection is made. Before beginning the test, it is suggested to
                ensure that the wiring is appropriate by injecting a current as big as 10 percent of the nominal current
                and reading the injected values
                from the relay. This can be done by simply clicking on “Test Hardware Congif” option. Then, the intended
                current must be specified in “Current Output” section, current injection channels are specified and the
                injection duration is selected.
                By clicking on the triangle at the top of the screen, the injection will keep going as long as the
                specified duration. The first part of the End to End test is related to ensuring stability or in other
                words, that if equal currents are
                injected from the two sides or in an external fault state, a trip is not issued. To test this state,
                “Sequencer” room is opened. At this point, the user needs to prepare the conditions for injecting values
                from both sides. It is possible
                to do so by selecting “Hardware Configuration” and specifying the two current groups in “Current Output
                Signal” section. Here, the first set is indicated by “IL1”, “IL2” and “IL3” which are located in front
                of X3, X1 and X2 elements, respectively.
                Now, the second set is activated in front of Y3, Y1 and Y2. To avoid confusion, it is better to change
                the values in front of X3, X1 and X2 to “Not Used” in “Voltage Output Signal” section. The intended
                inputs are activated in “Binary/Analog
                Input” header. By default, binary input 1 is set on the trip. For example, we set binary 2 for start and
                type “Start” phrase in front of “Label”. If the user wishes to adjust the output signal, for reasons
                such as specifying the state
                of the key, they can do so by using the binary output header. ”Save last actual data” option in “Extra
                Settings” section can be used to save the last injection data. Since longitudinal differential test,
                especially in “Search” section,
                needs a long time and this can lead to overheating of the device, it is possible to activate “Maximum
                fan during test” option so that the fan works at its maximum speed during current injection and avoids
                overheating of the device and
                stopping the test. By clicking on “Test Object Parameters” and then clicking on “Device”, it is possible
                to enter information about the test such as the title of the test, the manufacturer company, the relay
                type, the primary and secondary
                voltages and some other information that are needed in the report. It should be noted that it is
                possible to add the information related to the rows at the left side of this window after performing the
                test but the information related
                to the rows on the right side must be specified before initiating the test. In the next step, the
                current value is to be entered in accordance with the differential settings as well as the turns ratio
                and CT polarity of the sides. For
                example, suppose that the line current is 100 amps and the CT conversion ratio of the primary side is
                600 to 1 while the turns ratio of the other side is 800 to 1 and the polarity is set at “Toward Line”
                for both sides. It is possible
                to perform mathematical operations in all cells of the Vebko software without the need to use a
                calculator. By entering a value in a cell and right-clicking on it and then selecting “Equal Magnitudes”
                option, it is possible to enter the
                same value in all cells of a current injection side. Then the same process can be repeated for the other
                side. Now, since during a stability test the currents on both sides need to be equal in accordance with
                the CT turns ratio and have
                a 180 degree difference, the currents from one side are taken as the basis and a 180 degree difference
                is considered for currents from the other side. To do so, the current angle of one of the cells is
                entered and “Balance angle” option
                is used to apply the angle difference for the other phases. It is possible to view the amount and
                direction of the current values in “Vector View” window. By default, the currents are considered
                momentary but it is possible to select average
                values by selecting “Setting” header and then “RMS” option. If the stability test is only applied for
                one phase, it is possible to mark the checkbox for the corresponding phase so that only the signals
                related to that phase are displayed.
                In the next step, the test start conditions are adjusted. In this section, by selecting “Start Condition
                Repetition” option, a new page opens. In “Start Test Condition” section, the third option is related to
                the coordination of GPS for
                initiating the test. “Start Time” and “Next Full” options are related to the start time of the test and
                the duration of pause before every injection, respectively. If “Next full” option is unchecked, the
                injections will be done repeatedly
                and without any pause. In this section, a time should be specified as the test start time in
                coordination with the other side which is remote post. Before anything, it is necessary to ensure that
                the device and the GPS are synchronized
                by clicking on “Start Sync” option. If the user is using a 32-bit windows, clicking on “Set Windows Time
                with GPS” option, will cause the computer clock to be synchronized with the GPS. In “Data” section it is
                possible to view the information
                including the GPS time and latitude and longitude. Also, in “Satellite signal level” and “Satellite
                signal level history” section, it is possible to view other information related to the power and
                intensity of the signals received from
                the GPS. After applying the settings, by clicking on “Start” the test beings at the specified time. By
                applying these settings, it is possible to start current injection and ensure the stability of the
                condition. In the end, the file is
                saved and by selecting “Parameters” menu and then clicking on “Report”, after selecting the elements
                that are going to be added to the report, “Ok” option is selected. This will open the “Report” header so
                that by using the “Export Report”
                option or pressing “CTRL+P” keys, the report can be printed or saved as a file. It is worth mentioning
                that if the user is using a PDF management software, it is better for them to use “CTRL+P” shortcut so
                that the gap between the pages
                is removed and the report looks more well-organized. In the next step, “AMT Differential” room is used
                to perform the main test. Here, “Hardware Configuration” page is opened and the currents of the remote
                side or the other post are set
                at “Not Used” in “Output Target” section. It is also possible to save this combination of current
                channels by clicking on “Export” option at the bottom of the screen to use it in future tests. Now, by
                clicking on “Test Object Parameters”
                option, “Import from list” option from the “File” menu or the icon labeled “L” letter is selected. In
                this section, by entering the relay name in “Search” box, it is possible to select the XRIO or RIO
                corresponding to that relay and the
                software version. Here “7SD61” is entered. By double-clicking on the related “XRIO”, “File” menu and
                then “Load Relay Setting” is selected. In “Relay Config Type” section, the configuration type received
                from the relay is selected which
                is different for every brand. In “Config File Path” section, the path of this file is given to the
                software. Here, we are receiving the XRIO file using DIGSI 4 software of Siemens Company. By clicking on
                “Ok”, it is necessary to ensure
                that the relay parameters are entered correctly by viewing the number located in front of “Parameter
                Values Imported”. By clicking on “Ok” and closing the windows, the graph will be entered to the
                differential characteristic window. Before
                beginning the test, the “Test Object Parameters” window is opened again and “7SD61” subcategory is
                opened by clicking on the plus sign. In “Relay Parameter Section Local Relay” it is possible to view the
                information related to the local
                relay or the current post in different subcategories. In subcategory “Setting Group A”, it is possible
                to view the settings of different functions. By going to subcategory “87 DIFF PROT”, it is possible to
                examine the activity status of
                this parameter, time and current settings of pickup and trip, the inrush settings and the parameter
                related to the charge of the line. In “Relay parameter section Remote relay” section, it is possible to
                view the information related to
                the relay of the opposite post. Here, parameters with a green check mark in “State” section in front of
                them are the elements that are active in the relay of the opposite side. In this section, it is possible
                to receive the information
                about the relay of the opposite side from the setting file, xml file or even orally from the operator of
                the remote post and enter it into the “Value” field. Now, once more, “Test Object Parameter” is selected
                and “Line Differential” block
                is opened by double-clicking on it. The important point here is that the values entered for primary and
                secondary in “Protected Object” section must be the same in both local and remote posts. Also, these
                values need to be reviewed especially
                in “CT Nominal Values” section to ensure that the turn’s ratios are correct. Also, it is possible to
                view the test status graphically along with the parameters on it by opening “Medium Detail View” window
                from the “View” menu. After finishing
                this stage, it is time to perform different tests. To start, “On GPS” option is selected after selecting
                “Start Condition Repetition”. In this section, by clicking on “Start sync”, the satellite signals are
                detected and the time synchronization
                is done which may take up to few minutes. Keep in mind that normally, Shot Test and Search Test are
                performed in this Room. The first test examines the performance and non-performance in the Trip and No
                Trip area, respectively, and the
                second test examines the boundary between the TRIPPING and NO TRIP area. Specify the points by
                interpolating to measure the curve drawn in this environment and the actual performance of the relay. In
                the next step, after coordinating with
                the opposite side, some points are put on the differential characteristic and after adding them to the
                test table, it is possible to compare their coordination which is a combination of “ibias” and “idff” to
                ensure that the conditions
                are the same. By clicking on the cog icon at the bottom of the differential characteristic window, it is
                possible to use the features that help the user to better supervise the test Now, by returning to “Start
                Condition” tab, in “On GPS”
                section, a time is considered as the start time after coordination with the opposite side and then by
                unchecking “Next full” option whose function has been explained before, the test is initiated. To
                perform the "Search Test", you must
                first draw lines called "Search Line" in different parts of the chart. To drag the "Search Line" in the
                "Differential Characteristic" window, hold down "Ctrl" and left-click the mouse. Draw the direction you
                want on the characteristic
                curve. You will see that the "Search Line" information drawn is displayed in the "Search Test" line
                table. After drawing these lines, the information of these lines should be given to the opposite side so
                that the lines drawn on both sides
                are exactly the same and their order is the same. After dragging the "Search Line" and making
                adjustments in the Start-Condition window By testing a few points on the search line, it interpolates
                the characteristic curve and determines
                the exact location of the characteristic curve. At the end of the test and saving the file, it is enough
                to open the report setting window by selecting the parameters Have the result as an output file.

            <Search>DRAWING THE DISTANCE CHARACTERISTICS AND PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OF DRAWING THE QUAD CHARACTERISTIC IN
                SIEMENS 7SA522 RELAY Protection relays with Distance function are used to protect lines against faults
                in the network. In order to test this function,
                we must first draw its characteristic. Using Rio or Xrio is a simple solution to transfer settings and
                configure this function from relay and simulation of the distance characteristic in the test device.
                Using digital relays such as Import
                Rio and Xrio to draw protection characteristic will surely simplify the process of testing functions,
                including Distance. However, in the case of older relays such as static samples, in some cases, we still
                have to use step-by-step drawing
                and manual impedance characteristic. In addition, in some cases, we may not be able to get relay output
                in the form of files such as Xrio, CSV and Text for reasons such as software restrictions. In these
                cases, it is enough to open the
                Distance block from the Test Object Parameters section and use the Zone Settings header to draw the
                distance characteristic. At the top of the table, the New, Edit, Delete and Add duplicate options allow
                creating new zones, editing zones,
                deleting zones, and overwriting the zone, respectively. You can also have complete management over each
                zone using navigation options. In zone Details, you can also see details about trip time, impedance and
                values related to the duration
                of the operation and see the tolerance value. To get started, simply click on the New option to create a
                new zone. By default, this zone is marked as the tripe area for all fault loops. By selecting each zone
                and clicking on edit option,
                you can have a complete management of the type of distance element or specify the Trip and No Trip area.
                Impedance characteristics can be adjusted in the form of Quad and Mho type or lens in the relay. You can
                also use the default shapes
                for these three characteristics. Any added element can be a line or arc. Each element can be drawn by
                entering a point and angle. In the case of the Mho characteristic, the circle drawing is performed using
                the central point, radius and
                angle. After adding zones using different elements, you can specify the number, label, zone type and
                loop fault for it. Keep in mind that four different type can be specified for zones as follows:
                Tripping: It is used for zones that based
                on the relay settings, points inside trips. Starting: Used for zones that only lead to pickup of
                distance function. This pickup can lead to tripe after a certain time. Extended: This zone is only
                activated under certain conditions for
                example enabling recloser or teleprotection schemes Non-Tripping: In these zones, the relay will not
                issue trip command. It is also possible to disable the zones created in this list. After drawing the
                zones, trip time and related faults
                can be entered for each zone. Drawing the distance characteristic zone 1 forward direction in siemens
                7SA522 relay For example, we will review drawing the Quad characteristic of a Siemens 7SA522 relay
                sample here. Keep in mind that by
                going to the Setting Group section in Digsi 4 software and choosing Distance Protection and then,
                General Settings you can view the distance characteristic of the relay by selecting the Graph option. In
                the Distance Zones section, you
                can see the values related to different parameters of the Distance characteristic in different zones.
                Here, zones 1 to 3 in forward direction, zone 4 in reverse direction and finally zone 5, is
                non-directional. Considering the overall
                characteristic of distance for this relay, which is as follows, as well as the directional
                characteristic in page R and X, it is necessary to pay attention to the following points: - In general,
                six independent zones and one extra control
                zone are defined for each impedance fault loop in this relay. - The process of defining lines is based
                on the parameters R, X and φDist. - It is possible to include a cut area to define Load Encroachment. -
                Reach element R value can be
                defined separately for phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground faults so that we can see wider coverage of
                faults for ground faults. - For zone 1, another angle α can also be defined to avoid overreach caused by
                changing angles or more. This
                angle is not applicable to other zones. - φDist, defined in the relay address 1211 and referred to as
                Distance Angle or Distance angle, shows the rotation angle in the Distance component. This element is
                used for both Quad and MHO characteristics
                and can be adjusted to the same value as the line angle element 1105. Now it's time to drawing the
                distance characteristic. By revisiting the Zone Settings section and clicking on the New option, we
                select the Quad characteristic for the
                relay. Here, the value R moves the center of the line over the horizontal axis and the X value moves the
                center of the line over the vertical axis. The specified angle is also cause the line to rotate. The
                first line, while passing through
                the R axis with the value R1, that is, the resistance of zone 1 passes., has a φDist angle, which here
                is equal to the load angle of 82 degrees. In this way, we enter the value R equal to 24.899, X value
                equal to 0 and the angle value
                is 82 degrees. The second line is the horizontal line taking alpha equal to zero degrees with the
                specifications R=0, the value X is 6.211 and the angle is 180 degrees. The third line that passes
                through the source is also draw by the
                specifications R=0, X=0 and the angle derived from the manual, that is 300 degrees. The fourth line that
                passes through the source has a 22-degree angle in according to the manual. For this purpose, we enter
                the value R=0, X=0 and the
                angle at 338 degrees. The fifth line is draw by considering the value R equal to zero, X equal to -6.211
                and the angle equal to zero. By entering the above coordinates, zone 1 is created as Forward. Creating
                characteristics for reverse
                and non-directional zones also follows this process. By drawing the distance characteristic, it is
                possible to start the Shot Test and Search Test process in order to ensure the accuracy of the graphical
                characteristic.

                from entering the distance characteristic
                and finally prevents unwanted trip. This area usually overlaps with the trip area and is often activated
                only for three-phase fault loops. For this purpose, after adding the protection zones, add two more
                zones to be used as Load Encroachment
                Blinder. We place these zones on “Non tripping” and fault loop on L1-L2-L3. This characteristic requires

                that extends through the source, with coordinates R=65.36, X=58.85 and an angle of 42+180=222 degrees.
                The second component with R=65.36 and X=0 has an angle of 270 degrees, perpendicular to the horizontal
                axis. The third component of
                the Cartesian have coordinates R=65.36, X=-58.85 and -42 degree angle. You can create the final
                characteristic by disabling the Auto Close option. In order to draw the Load Encroachment characteristic
                on the left side of the Distance characteristic,
                we create three Cartesian components with specifications R=-65.36, X=-58.85 with an angle of 42 degrees,
                R=-65.36, X=0 with an angle of 90 degrees, and finally, R=-65.36, X=58.85 with an angle of 138 degrees.
                As mentioned above, during

                plotted "Check Line" should have cross
                at least one of the tolerance lines of the characteristic curve. Search Test is the last test performed
                on the "VI Starting" characteristic curve. The purpose of this test is to find the characteristic curve
                line. The "Search Line" method
                is the same as "Check Line". By performing the test, the software by testing several points on the
                search line to the characteristic curve interpolation and determine the exact location of the
                characteristic curve. Keep in mind that due
                to the required voltage level, by referring to the test object Parameters and then the Device block. you
                may need to increase the final voltage limit or V max When the test ends and saves the file, simply
                select parameters to open the
                report setting window to get the result as an output file by selecting the parameters that need to be
                entered in the final report.

            <Search>NON-DIRECTIONAL OVERCURRENT PROTECTION TEST IN AMR RELAY SIMPLE TEST USING TEMPLATES AMR modular
                relay of Vebko company supports various protection functions. Explanations of the capabilities and
                software environment of this relay have already
                been presented in the video related to differential protection test. After connecting to the AMR relay
                at first, simply load the device's hardware configuration from the Device menu by selecting the Read
                Hardware from Relay option. The
                default password is 123456 to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the signal,
                which if confirmed, if the current hardware is not the same as the relay hardware, the current hardware
                signals used in the VFC section
                are deleted. It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and current
                transformers are determined in the related card. Here the ratio of current card conversion is 200A to
                1A. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned
                earlier in the AMR software, config of some of the most widely used functions as are placed in the
                software as sample the user can send new settings to the relay by selecting each of them and applying
                the desired changes. For this purpose,
                a set of functions can be seen in the Relay VFC tab and in the Temp Functions section. It should be
                noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the blocks in the VFC are removed. Here the non-directional
                overcurrent function displayed
                under the name OC 50/51 is selected. In configuring this function, an OC Inverse block and two OC
                Definite blocks are used. They have different settings and the signals of a current card are assigned to
                their input from a measuring point.
                Finally, output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks. To
                change the settings, simply right-click on each block to access a set of options. Finally, the changes
                are sent to the relay. In this video,
                by double-clicking on blocks that contain constant time stages for non-directional overcurrent function,
                disables them and define the 1A and TMS current settings equal to 0.1 by double-clicking on the first
                stage, which is defined as reverse
                time. By making these changes, simply select Send Config and Setting to Relay from the Device menu
                again. In this way, the settings and configuration applied are moved to the relay. In the next step, by
                running AMPro software and opening
                the AMT Overcurrent room, it is enough to go to the Object Parameters test section and create the test
                characteristic after entering the information. Here, a reverse time characteristic is created by 1A and
                TMS=0.1 current settings. Keep
                in mind that it is also possible to test this characteristic using the Xrio file. In order to evaluate
                the performance of non-directional overcurrent function, two Trip Time and Pickup-Drop Off tests are
                performed. The purpose of Trip
                Time is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the performance time of this function and the purpose of
                pickup-drop off test is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the actual current of the performance
                threshold and of reset threshold
                of this function. Trip Test Three states including PreFault, Fault and PostFault are required to perform
                this test. PreFault time is suitable for 500 milliseconds, fault time should be greater than the maximum
                trip time, and Post Fault
                time is at least 500 milliseconds. PostFault time should be increased if the drop-off is not an
                instantaneous. The suggested points for reduced time functions are 1.5 times, 2 times and 4 times the
                regulatory current, and for constant
                time curves, 1.5 and 2 times the regulatory current. To detect the regulatory current of the second
                unit, two points can be added to the amount of 90 and 110 percent of the regulatory current of the
                second unit. By adding points, perform
                the test to check the performance of this function from the point of view of time accuracy.
                Pickup/Drop-off Test In order to perform this test, first determine how the diagnosis of pickup and
                drop-off is performed. This process can be
                done through a separate contact, namely Start, Relay LED viewing, or changing the setting for
                instantaneous function and using the trip contact. Here we used the Contact Pickup Relay. You can also
                put the current fault value in the desired
                range. Here the fault value is considered 5% by default. The performance range of overcurrent curves in
                the AMR relay starts from 1.1 regulatory current in the relay. Therefore, first, by enabling the Active
                Range Limits option in the
                Overcurrent Protection Parameters window, the Imin value is set to 1.1 Iref. In the next step, the
                current setting value for the pickup is placed on 1.1*1=1.1 amps. as it is shown By adding points, it is
                enough to perform the test and
                add the necessary elements to the report when it is finished.

                company supports various protection functions. Explanations of the capabilities and software environment
                of this relay have already been presented
                in the video related to differential protection test. After connecting to the AMR relay at first, simply
                load the device's hardware configuration from the Device menu by selecting the Read Hardware from Relay
                option. The default password
                is 123456 to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the signal, which if
                confirmed, if the current hardware is not the same as the relay hardware, the current hardware signals
                used in the VFC section are deleted.
                It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and current transformers are
                determined in the related card. Here, the current card conversion ratio is 200A to 1A and the voltage
                card conversion ratio is 63000
                to 100V. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned earlier in AMR software, the config of some of the most
                widely used functions, as an example, are placed in the software as samples; and the user can select any
                of them apply the desired
                changes and send the new settings to the relay. For this purpose, a set of functions can be seen in the
                Relay VFC tab and in the Temp Functions section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp
                Function, the available blocks in the
                VFC are removed. Here the Under Voltage function displayed with the name UV 27 is selected. In the
                configure of this function, to calculate the line-by-line voltages, first the relay voltage card signals
                are assigned to the Voltage Quantities
                block inputs and then assigned to the Undervoltage block. Also, current card signals connected to the
                current transformers CT of the same feeder are assigned to the Undervoltage block for current
                monitoring. Finally, undervoltage block
                output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks. The purpose is to
                test the Undervoltage function with AND logic, so the sample of line-by-line voltages are used. By
                double-clicking on the Undervoltage
                block, two stages are defined here. The first stage with a 50V setting and a performance time of 1.5
                seconds and a second stage with a 45V setting and a performance time of 1 second. The Drop Ratio value
                is also 1.2 for both stages by
                default. Since there is no need for Current Supervision, option I superv. is disabled. After this, the
                pickup signals of both stages are removed from the unit with current monitoring and the necessary
                signals are added to the normal units
                without current monitoring. In the final step, these changes are applied to the relay to be prepared for
                testing. In the next step, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT Under/Over Voltage Test, simply
                go to the Test Object Parameters
                section and enter the basic information. Testing this function can also be performed in AMT sequencer
                room, but in order to make the states and test management more comfortable, this process is performed in
                the AMT Under/Over Voltage Test.
                First, the information is entered in the General Information section. This information can include relay
                type, serial number and other information such as post name and feeder/b number. In the Test Setting
                section, the UV 27 option is
                selected. Here Vnom sec, 100 volts is selected. Also, the performance mode is located on AND logic to
                reduce the voltage of all three phases of the specified value to provide the test. In order to evaluate
                the performaning of Under Voltage
                protection, two time tests Trip time and Voltage Performance Test pickup/drop-off are performed.
                Assuming there are two performance stages for Under Voltage protection, regulatory voltage value,
                voltage type, performance time and more
                are entered in the Data Table section for both stages of operation. After this, in order to be more
                accurate in testing, continuous ramp option is selected in state setting section, C1 and C2 contacts are
                considered for detection of trip
                and pickup/drop-off, respectively. In addition to contact, the relay pickup status can be recorded with
                LED or even adjusted to instantaneous Under Voltage protection. By entering the necessary settings in
                the Test Plan section, schedule
                the test in a way that both time test and voltage performance testing are performed. In the Fault Type
                section, by selecting the L1L2L3 option, states are created for the function test based on the Under
                Voltage of all three phases. By
                enabling Time Test, the state related to the performance time check is created. Vtest is the voltage
                value that the performance of the function in each stage is guaranteed. By selecting yes for PU Test and
                DOU Test elements, it is confirmed
                to perform pickup drop-off tests. In the PU Val. Assessment section, the evaluation of the pickup value
                of the function, in the PU Start section, the initial voltage of the pickup process, in the PU end
                section, the final voltage limit
                for the pickup test, and in the DOU End section, the final value for the drop-off test is entered. In
                the Total section, the total duration of the test is entered. By Clicking on the Init Test option,
                creating states will be done based
                on user-imported settings. These states can be seen in the Table View window. This way, the test can be
                performed to evaluate the necessary items. In the Measurement View section, in Assessment ramp tab you
                can see the assessment of the
                pickup drop-off and in the Time Assessment tab, you can see the performance time assessments of each
                stage can be seen. Keep in mind that when the test reaches the second stage assessment section, a
                message appears to the user to disable
                the first stage in order to provide non-interference conditions. This can be done by removing elements
                related to the first stage from the blocks associated with pickup and trip. Another solution is to
                equalize the setting of two stages.
                For this purpose, once again refer to AMR software and set the first stage settings equal to the second
                stage settings the settings are then to be sent to the relay. In the end, the results are added to the
                report by clicking on the Add
                to Report option. These results are visible in the Report window.

                then assigned to the Overvoltage block. Finally, overvoltage output signals are assigned to Binary
                Output and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks. Since the purpose is to test the overvoltage function
                with OR logic, analog signals related
                to the voltage sample must be applied directly to the overvoltage block to increase the voltage of each

                voltage card conversion ratio is 63,000
                to 100V. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned earlier in the AMR software, configuring some of the
                most widely used functions are placed in the software as samples the user can send new settings to the
                relay by selecting each of them
                and applying the desired changes. For this purpose, a set of functions can be seen in the Relay VFC tab
                and in the Temp Functions section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the blocks
                in the VFC are removed. Here
                the negative sequence overcurrent function displayed with the name NS 46 is selected. In this template,
                first, the signals of a current card are given to the Current Quantities block to create different
                current sequences in its output.
                In the default config of the Negative Sequence function, a block with different stages and signals of a
                current card with negative sequence is assigned to its input. Finally, output signals are assigned to
                Binary Outputs and relay LEDs
                by Output and LED blocks. To change the settings, simply right-click on each block to access a set of
                options. By double-clicking on the Negative Sequence block, the settings for its various stages are
                visible. Here, the first stage with
                normal Inverse setting characteristic has a current of 0.1 amps, the TMS equals 1, and the two constant
                time stages with a current setting of 0.2 and 0.5A have a time setting of 1.5 and 0.5 seconds,
                respectively. By making these changes,
                simply select Send Config and Setting to Relay from the Device menu again. This way, the settings and
                applied configuration are moved to the relay. Cut from this part until the overcurrent room opens. In
                the next step, by running AMPro
                software and opening the AMT Overcurrent room, it is enough to go to the Test Object Parameters section
                and create the test characteristic after entering the information. The test characteristic is created in
                the Elements tab in the Negative
                Sequence section. Therefore, the default characteristic in this section is removed first. First, a
                reverse time characteristic is created with a current setting of 0.1 amps and TMS=1. The next
                characteristic is created by current setting
                of 0.2 and a time of 1.5 seconds. Finally, the third characteristic is created by adjusting the current
                setting of 0.5 and the time of 0.5 seconds. Keep in mind that it is also possible to test this function
                using the Xrio file. In order
                to evaluate the performance of negative sequence overcurrent function, two Trip Time and Pickup-Drop Off
                tests are performed. The purpose of Trip Time is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the performance
                time of this function and
                the purpose of pickup-drop off test is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the actual current of the
                performance threshold and the reset threshold of this function. Trip Test To perform this test three
                states ones including PreFault,
                Fault and PostFault are required. PreFault time is suitable for 500 milliseconds, fault time should be
                greater than the maximum trip time, and Post Fault time is at least 500 milliseconds. PostFault time
                should be increased if the drop-off
                is not instantaneous. The suggested points for reduced time functions are 1.5 times, 2 times and 4 times
                the regulatory current, and for constant time curves, 1.5 and 2 times the regulatory current. These
                points are added to the fault
                type 12 to prepare the test. Keep in mind that due to the existence of three different characteristic,
                in some cases, the added points with the mentioned coefficients fall on the other characteristic. In
                these cases, other points are manually
                added on each characteristicto ensure accurate time performance. To detect the regulatory current of the
                second and third units, two points can be added to 90 and 110 percent of the regulatory current of these
                units in order to perform
                a kind of pickup drop-off test for these characteristics. Once again, the Max Fault Time value is set
                based on the highest number inserted in the t nom section. By adding points, perform the test to check
                the performance of this function
                from the point of view of time accuracy. Pickup/Drop-off Test In order to perform this test, it is first
                to determine how the diagnosis of pickup and drop-off is performed. This process can be done through a
                separate contact, like Start,
                Relay LED viewing, or changing the setting for the instantaneous of the function and using the trip
                contact. Here we used the relay pickup contact. You can also put the current fault value in the desired
                range. Here the fault value is
                considered 5% by default. The performance range of overcurrent curves in the AMR relay starts from 1.1
                regulatory current in the relay. Therefore, first, by enabling the Active Range Limits option in the
                Overcurrent Protection Parameters
                window, Imin value are determined to be 1.1*0.1=0.11 Iref. In the next step, the current adjustment
                value for the pickup is placed on 0.1*1.1=0.11 amps. By adding this point, it is enough to perform the
                test and add the necessary elements
                to the report when it is finished.

                of Vebko company supports various protection functions. Explanations of the capabilities and software
                environment of this relay have already
                been presented in the video related to differential protection test. After connecting to the AMR relay
                at first, simply load the device's hardware configuration from the Device menu by selecting the Read
                Hardware from Relay option. The
                default password is 123456 in order to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the
                signal, which if confirmed, if the current hardware is not the same as the relay hardware, the current
                hardware signals used in the
                VFC section are deleted. It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and
                current transformers are determined in the related card. Here the ratio of current card conversion is
                200A to 1A. First, enter the VFC
                page: As mentioned earlier in the AMR software, configuring some of the most widely used functions as
                examples are placed in the software and the user can send new settings to the relay by selecting each of
                them and applying the desired
                changes. For this purpose, a set of functions can be seen in the Relay VFC tab and in the Temp Functions
                section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the blocks in the VFC are removed.
                Here the directional overcurrent
                function displayed with the name OC 67 is selected. In Configuring, this function uses an OC Inverse
                block and two OC Definite blocks that have different settings and the signals of a current card are
                assigned to their input from a measuring
                point. Finally, output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks.
                To change the settings, simply right-click on each block to access a set of options. Finally, the
                changes are sent to the relay. In
                this video, by double-clicking on blocks that contain constant time stages for the directional
                overcurrent function, disables them and define the 1A and TMS current settings equal to 0.1 by
                double-clicking on the first stage, which is
                defined as reverse time. By double-clicking on the Direction block, the elements related to the
                directional function include rotation angle and ground polarization. After this, the changes will be
                sent to the relay by selecting send config
                and setting to relay option. In the next step, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT Overcurrent
                room, it is enough to go to the Object Parameters test section and create the test characteristic after
                entering the information.
                Keep in mind that it is also possible to test this function using the Xrio file. Here, the current
                setting value is equal to 1 amp, TMS is 0.1. In the overcurrent test, it is required to set two
                parameters maximum torque angle and sector
                operation. To do this from the Overcurrent window and the Relay Parameters tab, the directional option
                is selected and from the Element tab, the Directional section is placed on forward. Then enter under the
                Define Element Directional
                Behavior tab and the maximum torque angle and Sector operation parameters are equal to -45 and 172
                degrees, respectively. In directional overcurrent relays, In order to better performance of relay, in
                orientation and reaching the MTA value
                ,the rotation of the reference voltage angle is used.. The performance area or forward area in this
                relay is set from -131 degrees to +41 degrees. In order to investigate the directional overcurrent
                function, in addition to the time of
                operation and current, the angle of performance should also be investigated. For this purpose,
                performance time tests are performed along with amplitude and phase tests. In the time test, the
                accuracy of the performance time is investigated
                and in the amplitude and phase test, the detection and evaluation of the accuracy of the actual current
                and the actual angle of the performance threshold and reset threshold are considered. Cross Polarized
                method is used in AMR Vebko relay,
                i.e. using healthy phases to detect fault direction. For example, in case of faults in phase A, the
                relay uses VBC reference voltage and IA current to detect the fault current direction. The Forward or
                Reverse area means the part where
                the relay must detect the fault will be determined by the start angle and end angle. Test Test In order
                to test the DOC function, three states are considered. The first state for 500 milliseconds, normal
                conditions this means that it will
                inject a nominal voltage with zero current. In the second state, the fault conditions are applied and
                the current is selected for all phases of L1E-L2E-L3E in the range of 2 to 4 times the nominal current.
                The duration of this state should
                be greater than the nominal time of the relay trip. The third state will also be activated as post-Fault
                with zero voltage and current for 500 milliseconds. In order to see better performance of the function,
                from the View menu, the Detail
                View window opens. After adding double points and four times the regulatory current at the best possible
                angle in terms of performance of the function i.e. -45 degrees for the L1E-L2E-L3E falt types, a point
                in the No Trip area here at
                an angle of 135 degrees is tested. Due to the nature of the two-phase fault, the currents in this fault
                will have a phase difference of 180 degrees so that the 3I0 current is not created and the 67N function
                is not activated. Pickup-Drop
                off Test In order to perform the Pickup-Drop off test, you can also use a relay or LED contact and even
                a setting change to instantaneous the function. For this purpose, three states are needed for example in
                the first state, the normal
                network conditions, applied, in the second state the pickup test and in the third state the drop-off
                test is performed. In the second state, for pickup and drop-off test of angle, the current value will be
                twice the regulatory current.
                these states are performed in the Overcurrent room automatically by entering the settings by the user.
                The performance range of overcurrent curves in the AMR relay starts from 1.1 regulatory current in the
                relay. Therefore, first, by enabling
                the Active Range Limits option in the Overcurrent Protection Parameters window, the Imin value is set to
                1.1 Iref. In the next step, the current adjustment value for the pickup test of the current value is
                placed on 1.1*1=1.1 amps. This
                test is performed at the best possible angle in terms of relay performance i.e. -45 degrees. After the
                current pick up-drop off, it is time to Pick up-drop off on the angle. For this purpose, as mentioned
                above, the current value is applied
                twice as much as the regulatory current, and once the trend is performed for the upper limit of the
                angle, i.e. 41 degrees, and once for the lower limit of the angle, i.e. -131 degrees. By adding the
                necessary tests and performing, you
                can finally add favorites items to the report.

                running AMPro software and opening
                the AMT Overcurrent room, it is enough to go to the Object Parameters test section and create the test

                TMS=0.1 current settings. Keep
                in mind that it is also possible to test this characteristic using the Xrio file. In order to evaluate
                the performance of non-directional overcurrent function, two Trip Time and Pickup-Drop Off tests are
                performed. The purpose of Trip
                Time is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the performance time of this function and the purpose of
                pickup-drop off test is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the actual current of the performance
                threshold and of reset threshold
                of this function. Trip Test Three states including PreFault, Fault and PostFault are required to perform
                this test. PreFault time is suitable for 500 milliseconds, fault time should be greater than the maximum
                trip time, and Post Fault

                put the current fault value in the desired

                Overcurrent Protection Parameters window, the Imin value is set to 1.1 Iref. In the next step, the
                current setting value for the pickup is placed on 1.1*1=1.1 amps. as it is shown By adding points, it is
                enough to perform the test and
                add the necessary elements to the report when it is finished.

                blocks. You can also access
                the settings of this function by double-clicking on the Distance block. By scrolling on the signals of
                each block, more signals are displayed if available. Also visible from the Signals tab, the set of
                output signals assigned to the distance
                block. After applying the desired changes, using the Ctrl+ E combination keys or by using the File menu
                and selecting the Export XRio option, the XRio file is downloaded from the software as an output
                containing the distance function settings.
                Next, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT Distance room, simply upload the Xrio file you saved
                in the software environment in the previous step. By loading the relay distance characteristic, conduct
                the test based on the periodic
                testing system of Iran's power transmission network protection systems. Firstly, shot test is performed,
                which aims to evaluate the time of different tripe zones. The Pre Fault value is at least 1 second and
                the Post Fault value is at
                least 500 milliseconds. In order to perform this test, we place points on 80% of the value of each zone
                in line with the real axis and also in line with the angle of the line. In line with the real axis, the
                test will be performed for
                all phase-to-ground characteristics in the A-N and phase-to-phase fault loops in the B-C and ABC fault
                loops. In line angle, testing is performed for all phase-to-ground characteristics in the C-N and
                phase-to-phase fault loops in A-B
                and ABC fault loops. By performing the test, the performance time for the added points can be seen in
                different zones. In the second step, the Test Check is performed to check the performance time and range
                of the zones in the upper and
                lower part of the Rich value by drawing the lines on the R, X axes and in line with the angle of the
                line. Here, in order to avoid prolonging the test process, the check test is performed only for
                three-phase fault type. By performing
                of this test, the results of the studies will once again be visible. In the final step, search test is
                performed with the aim of searching the curve, detecting and evaluating the real range of each distance
                relay zones. For this purpose,
                search line should be selected in line with the R, X, angle of the line and the location of the
                collision of the sides. This test is performed in line with the real axis and in a way that passes
                through all zones as a one-time repetition
                for each search line, for all phase-to-ground characteristics in the A-N and phase-by-phase fault loops
                in the B-C and ABC fault loops. Here, in order to avoid prolonging the test process, this test is only
                performed for the ABC fault
                loop. In line angle and so that we cross all zones again, once repetition is performed for each line and
                for all phase-to-ground characteristics in the C-N and phase-by-phase fault loops in the A-B and ABC
                fault loops. Finally, at the
                collision site, a repeat is performed once for each search line for phase-to-ground characteristic in
                the A-N fault loop and phase to phase in the B-C fault loop. As mentioned above, in order to prevent the
                prolongation of the test process,
                these tests are only performed for the ABC fault loop. When the test is finished, you can specify the
                elements in the report and save the output in different formats such as PDF.

            <Search>DIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION TEST IN AMR RELAY SIMPLE TEST USING TEMPLATES AMR multi-function relay with
                modular and expandable hardware structure enables the development of various functions. The AMR relay
                has four regulatory groups and can save
                Event log, Trip Log and Comtrade. The relay has also successfully passed tests of protection relays in
                accordance with the IEC-60255 standard. In order to configure this relay, you can use AMR software. The
                Relay Hardware software module
                enables relay hardware configuration and Relay VFC module, allowing logic writing and implementation of
                various functions from easiest to most complex configurations. Also, using the Signal Routing module,
                functions can be implemented
                in the fastest way. After adjusting the settings, it is possible to help the relay test more easier
                through test devices by receiving the Xrio file as an output containing the functions settings. The AMR
                software can be downloaded from
                the website of The Vebko Company Vebko.org. First, the software connects to the relay using the LAN
                cable and entering the relay IP in the Communication window. After connecting to the AMR relay at first,
                simply load the hardware modules
                and the default configuration of the device by selecting the Read Hardware from Relay option. The
                default password is 123456 in order to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the
                signal, which, if confirmed, the
                current hardware signals used in the VFC section will be deleted, if the current hardware is not the
                same as the relay hardware. It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and
                current transformers are determined
                in the related card. Here, the ratio of the current card conversion is 200A to 1A and the voltage card
                conversion ratio is 63,000 to 100V. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned earlier in the AMR software,
                configuring some of the most
                widely used functions as examples are placed in the software and the user can send new settings to the
                relay by selecting each of them and applying the desired changes. For this purpose, a set of functions
                can be seen in the Relay VFC
                tab and in the Temp Functions section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the
                blocks in the VFC are removed. Here the differential function displayed with the name Diff is selected.
                In Config of this function, the
                signals of the current cards are connected to the differential block input. Finally, differential block
                output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks. You can access
                the settings of this function
                by double-clicking on the differential block. After applying the desired changes, using the Ctrl+ E
                combination keys or by using the File menu and selecting the Export Xrio option, the Xrio file is
                downloaded from the software as an output
                containing differential function settings. Next, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT
                Differential room, simply upload the Xrio file you saved in the software environment in the previous
                step. By loading the differential characteristic
                of the relay, conduct the test based on the periodic testing system of Iran's power transmission network
                protection systems. Here we select PreFault and Postfault time 500 milliseconds and Fault time 200
                milliseconds. Firstly, points should
                be selected within blocking and Tripping areas. The relay performance time during testing must match the
                time set in the differential relay. At each slope of the curve, test points should be established at
                least in the characteristic breakpoints
                and outside of the current tolerance and close to it and on either side of the yield curve. In the lower
                parts of the characteristic, inactivity and in the upper parts of the characteristic, the moment
                performance must be recorded. In
                order to avoid prolonging the test time, fault types L1-E, L2-L3 and L1L2L3 are selected. In the second
                step, the Check Test will be performed to calculate the performance and Inactivity on both sides of the
                characteristic, based on the
                time of the shots performed. This test is performed in fault types L1-E, L2-L3 and L1L2L3. In the next
                step, by using Search Test, we evaluate the real curve of differential protection performance. According
                to the system, in search test,
                at least two search lines should be selected on the performance curve for each part of the curve slope,
                one of these lines is better to be in the characteristic fracture area. This test is performed in fault
                types L1-E, L2-L3 and L1L2L3.
                Pickup-Drop Test As one of the functional tests, you can use pickup drop feature for differential
                characteristic. The three options Primary Side, -Secondary Side and bias allow pickup drop for
                differential component on the primary, secondary
                side as well as bias current, respectively. For this purpose, just add points for different Fault Type
                and run the test. Here, the drop-off pickup is evaluated for all types on primary and secondary sides.
                Stability test Another function
                test, is available from AMT Differential's Room Stability tab. In this section, considering Idiff=0, you
                can specify the bias value as a coefficient against the nominal current to check the trans stability in
                this case. This test is performed
                in all fault types. When the test is finished, you can specify the elements in the report and save the
                output in different formats such as PDF.

            <Search>UNDER VOLTAGE PROTECTION TEST IN AMR RELAY SIMPLE TEST USING TEMPLATES AMR modular relay of Vebko
                company supports various protection functions. Explanations of the capabilities and software environment
                of this relay have already been presented
                in the video related to differential protection test. After connecting to the AMR relay at first, simply
                load the device's hardware configuration from the Device menu by selecting the Read Hardware from Relay
                option. The default password
                is 123456 to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the signal, which if
                confirmed, if the current hardware is not the same as the relay hardware, the current hardware signals
                used in the VFC section are deleted.
                It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and current transformers are
                determined in the related card. Here, the current card conversion ratio is 200A to 1A and the voltage
                card conversion ratio is 63000
                to 100V. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned earlier in AMR software, the config of some of the most
                widely used functions, as an example, are placed in the software as samples; and the user can select any
                of them apply the desired
                changes and send the new settings to the relay. For this purpose, a set of functions can be seen in the
                Relay VFC tab and in the Temp Functions section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp
                Function, the available blocks in the
                VFC are removed. Here the Under Voltage function displayed with the name UV 27 is selected. In the
                configure of this function, to calculate the line-by-line voltages, first the relay voltage card signals
                are assigned to the Voltage Quantities
                block inputs and then assigned to the Undervoltage block. Also, current card signals connected to the
                current transformers CT of the same feeder are assigned to the Undervoltage block for current
                monitoring. Finally, undervoltage block
                output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks. The purpose is to
                test the Undervoltage function with AND logic, so the sample of line-by-line voltages are used. By
                double-clicking on the Undervoltage
                block, two stages are defined here. The first stage with a 50V setting and a performance time of 1.5
                seconds and a second stage with a 45V setting and a performance time of 1 second. The Drop Ratio value
                is also 1.2 for both stages by
                default. Since there is no need for Current Supervision, option I superv. is disabled. After this, the
                pickup signals of both stages are removed from the unit with current monitoring and the necessary
                signals are added to the normal units
                without current monitoring. In the final step, these changes are applied to the relay to be prepared for
                testing. In the next step, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT Under/Over Voltage Test, simply
                go to the Test Object Parameters
                section and enter the basic information. Testing this function can also be performed in AMT sequencer
                room, but in order to make the states and test management more comfortable, this process is performed in
                the AMT Under/Over Voltage Test.
                First, the information is entered in the General Information section. This information can include relay
                type, serial number and other information such as post name and feeder/b number. In the Test Setting
                section, the UV 27 option is
                selected. Here Vnom sec, 100 volts is selected. Also, the performance mode is located on AND logic to
                reduce the voltage of all three phases of the specified value to provide the test. In order to evaluate
                the performaning of Under Voltage
                protection, two time tests Trip time and Voltage Performance Test pickup/drop-off are performed.
                Assuming there are two performance stages for Under Voltage protection, regulatory voltage value,
                voltage type, performance time and more
                are entered in the Data Table section for both stages of operation. After this, in order to be more
                accurate in testing, continuous ramp option is selected in state setting section, C1 and C2 contacts are
                considered for detection of trip
                and pickup/drop-off, respectively. In addition to contact, the relay pickup status can be recorded with
                LED or even adjusted to instantaneous Under Voltage protection. By entering the necessary settings in
                the Test Plan section, schedule
                the test in a way that both time test and voltage performance testing are performed. In the Fault Type
                section, by selecting the L1L2L3 option, states are created for the function test based on the Under
                Voltage of all three phases. By
                enabling Time Test, the state related to the performance time check is created. Vtest is the voltage
                value that the performance of the function in each stage is guaranteed. By selecting yes for PU Test and
                DOU Test elements, it is confirmed
                to perform pickup drop-off tests. In the PU Val. Assessment section, the evaluation of the pickup value
                of the function, in the PU Start section, the initial voltage of the pickup process, in the PU end
                section, the final voltage limit
                for the pickup test, and in the DOU End section, the final value for the drop-off test is entered. In
                the Total section, the total duration of the test is entered. By Clicking on the Init Test option,
                creating states will be done based
                on user-imported settings. These states can be seen in the Table View window. This way, the test can be
                performed to evaluate the necessary items. In the Measurement View section, in Assessment ramp tab you
                can see the assessment of the
                pickup drop-off and in the Time Assessment tab, you can see the performance time assessments of each
                stage can be seen. Keep in mind that when the test reaches the second stage assessment section, a
                message appears to the user to disable
                the first stage in order to provide non-interference conditions. This can be done by removing elements
                related to the first stage from the blocks associated with pickup and trip. Another solution is to
                equalize the setting of two stages.
                For this purpose, once again refer to AMR software and set the first stage settings equal to the second

            <Search>OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION TEST IN AMR RELAY SIMPLE TEST USING TEMPLATES AMR modular relay of Vebko
                company supports various protection functions. Explanations of the capabilities and software environment
                of this relay have already been presented
                in the video related to differential protection test. After connecting to the AMR relay at first, simply
                load the device's hardware configuration from the Device menu by selecting the Read Hardware from Relay
                option. The default password
                is 123456 to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the signal, which if
                confirmed, if the current hardware is not the same as the relay hardware, the current hardware signals
                used in the VFC section are deleted.
                It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and current transformers are
                determined in the related card. Here, the ratio of the current card conversion is 200A to 1A and the
                voltage card conversion ratio is
                63,000 to 100V. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned earlier in the AMR software, configuring some of
                the most widely used functions are placed in the software as samples. The user can send new settings to
                the relay by selecting each
                of them and applying the desired changes. For this purpose, a set of functions can be seen in the Relay
                VFC tab and in the Temp Functions section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the
                blocks in the VFC are removed.
                Here the overvoltage function displayed with the name OV 59 is selected. In the config of this function,
                to calculate the line-by-line voltages, First the relay voltage card signals are assigned to the Voltage
                Quantities block inputs and
                then assigned to the Overvoltage block. Finally, overvoltage output signals are assigned to Binary
                Output and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks. Since the purpose is to test the overvoltage function
                with OR logic, analog signals related
                to the voltage sample must be applied directly to the overvoltage block to increase the voltage of each
                phase, the relay function should occur. By double-clicking the Overvoltage block, two stages will be
                defined here. The first stage
                with a 65V set, performance time of 2 seconds and a second stage with a 70V set and a performance time
                of 4 seconds. In addition, Operation Quantity is placed on Vphn/V1/V2 to include single-phase
                performance. Finally, the changes are
                sent to the relay. In the next step, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT Under/Over Voltage
                Test, simply go to the Object Parameters test section and enter the basic information. Testing this
                function can also be performed in
                AMT sequencer room, but in order to make the states and test management more comfortable, this process
                is performed in the AMT Under/Over Voltage Test. Firstly, the information is entered in the General
                Information section. This information
                can include relay type, serial number and other information such as post name and feeder/b number. In
                the Test Setting section, the OV 59 option is selected. Here Vnom sec, 100 volts is selected. Also, the
                performance mode is located on
                the OR logic to increase the voltage of each phase from the specified value to provide the test. In
                order to evaluate the performance of overvoltage protection, two time tests Trip time and Voltage
                Performance Test pickup/drop-off are
                performed. Assuming two performance stages for overvoltage protection, regulatory voltage value, voltage
                type, performance time and more are entered in the Data Table section for both stages of operation.
                After this, to be more accurate
                in testing, continuous ramp option is selected in state setting section; then C1 and C2 contacts are
                considered for trip diagnosis and pickup/drop-off, respectively. The status of the relay pickup can be
                recorded with LED in addition to
                contact, or even adjusting to instantaneous over-voltage protection. By entering the necessary settings
                in the Test Plan section, schedule the test in a way that both time test and voltage performance testing
                are performed. In fault type,
                by selecting L1E, L2E and L3E, states are created to test the function based on the voltage increase of
                each phase independently. By enabling Time Test, the state related to the performance time check is
                created. Vtest is the voltage value
                at which the performance of the function in each stage is guaranteed. By selecting yes for PU Test and
                DOU Test elements, it will be confirmed to perform pickup drop-off tests. In the PU Val. Assessment
                section, the evaluation of the pickup
                value of the function, in the PU Start section, the initial voltage of the pickup process, in the PU end
                section, the final voltage limit for the pickup test, and in the DOU End section, the final value for
                the drop-off test is entered.
                In the Total section, the total duration of the test is entered. By Clicking on the Init Test option,
                states are created based on user-imported settings. These states can be seen in the Table View window.
                This way, the test can be performed
                to evaluate the necessary items. In the Measurement View section, in Assessment ramp, the assessment of
                the pickup drop-off can be seen. In the Time Assessment tab, the performance time assessments of each
                stage can be observed. Keep in
                mind that when the test reaches the second stage assessment section, a message has appeared to tell the
                user to disable the first stage in order to provide the conditions for non-interference. This can be
                done by removing elements related
                to the first stage from the blocks associated with pickup and trip. Another solution is to equalize the
                setting of two stages. For this purpose, once again refer to AMR software, set the first stage equal to
                the second stage settings and
                the settings are sent to the relay. In the end, the results are added to the report by clicking on the
                Add to Report option. The results are visible in the Report window.

                and in the Temp Functions section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the blocks
                in the VFC are removed. Here
                the negative sequence overcurrent function displayed with the name NS 46 is selected. In this template,
                first, the signals of a current card are given to the Current Quantities block to create different
                current sequences in its output.
                In the default config of the Negative Sequence function, a block with different stages and signals of a
                current card with negative sequence is assigned to its input. Finally, output signals are assigned to
                Binary Outputs and relay LEDs
                by Output and LED blocks. To change the settings, simply right-click on each block to access a set of
                options. By double-clicking on the Negative Sequence block, the settings for its various stages are
                visible. Here, the first stage with
                normal Inverse setting characteristic has a current of 0.1 amps, the TMS equals 1, and the two constant
                time stages with a current setting of 0.2 and 0.5A have a time setting of 1.5 and 0.5 seconds,
                respectively. By making these changes,
                simply select Send Config and Setting to Relay from the Device menu again. This way, the settings and
                applied configuration are moved to the relay. Cut from this part until the overcurrent room opens. In
                the next step, by running AMPro
                software and opening the AMT Overcurrent room, it is enough to go to the Test Object Parameters section
                and create the test characteristic after entering the information. The test characteristic is created in
                the Elements tab in the Negative
                Sequence section. Therefore, the default characteristic in this section is removed first. First, a
                reverse time characteristic is created with a current setting of 0.1 amps and TMS=1. The next
                characteristic is created by current setting
                of 0.2 and a time of 1.5 seconds. Finally, the third characteristic is created by adjusting the current
                setting of 0.5 and the time of 0.5 seconds. Keep in mind that it is also possible to test this function
                using the Xrio file. In order
                to evaluate the performance of negative sequence overcurrent function, two Trip Time and Pickup-Drop Off
                tests are performed. The purpose of Trip Time is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the performance
                time of this function and
                the purpose of pickup-drop off test is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the actual current of the
                performance threshold and the reset threshold of this function. Trip Test To perform this test three
                states ones including PreFault,
                Fault and PostFault are required. PreFault time is suitable for 500 milliseconds, fault time should be
                greater than the maximum trip time, and Post Fault time is at least 500 milliseconds. PostFault time
                should be increased if the drop-off
                is not instantaneous. The suggested points for reduced time functions are 1.5 times, 2 times and 4 times
                the regulatory current, and for constant time curves, 1.5 and 2 times the regulatory current. These
                points are added to the fault
                type 12 to prepare the test. Keep in mind that due to the existence of three different characteristic,
                in some cases, the added points with the mentioned coefficients fall on the other characteristic. In
                these cases, other points are manually
                added on each characteristicto ensure accurate time performance. To detect the regulatory current of the
                second and third units, two points can be added to 90 and 110 percent of the regulatory current of these
                units in order to perform
                a kind of pickup drop-off test for these characteristics. Once again, the Max Fault Time value is set
                based on the highest number inserted in the t nom section. By adding points, perform the test to check
                the performance of this function
                from the point of view of time accuracy. Pickup/Drop-off Test In order to perform this test, it is first
                to determine how the diagnosis of pickup and drop-off is performed. This process can be done through a
                separate contact, like Start,
                Relay LED viewing, or changing the setting for the instantaneous of the function and using the trip
                contact. Here we used the relay pickup contact. You can also put the current fault value in the desired
                range. Here the fault value is
                considered 5% by default. The performance range of overcurrent curves in the AMR relay starts from 1.1
                regulatory current in the relay. Therefore, first, by enabling the Active Range Limits option in the
                Overcurrent Protection Parameters
                window, Imin value are determined to be 1.1*0.1=0.11 Iref. In the next step, the current adjustment
                value for the pickup is placed on 0.1*1.1=0.11 amps. By adding this point, it is enough to perform the
                test and add the necessary elements
                to the report when it is finished.

                VFC section are deleted. It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and
                current transformers are determined in the related card. Here the ratio of current card conversion is
                200A to 1A. First, enter the VFC
                page: As mentioned earlier in the AMR software, configuring some of the most widely used functions as
                examples are placed in the software and the user can send new settings to the relay by selecting each of
                them and applying the desired
                changes. For this purpose, a set of functions can be seen in the Relay VFC tab and in the Temp Functions
                section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the blocks in the VFC are removed.
                Here the directional overcurrent
                function displayed with the name OC 67 is selected. In Configuring, this function uses an OC Inverse
                block and two OC Definite blocks that have different settings and the signals of a current card are
                assigned to their input from a measuring
                point. Finally, output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks.
                To change the settings, simply right-click on each block to access a set of options. Finally, the
                changes are sent to the relay. In
                this video, by double-clicking on blocks that contain constant time stages for the directional
                overcurrent function, disables them and define the 1A and TMS current settings equal to 0.1 by
                double-clicking on the first stage, which is
                defined as reverse time. By double-clicking on the Direction block, the elements related to the
                directional function include rotation angle and ground polarization. After this, the changes will be
                sent to the relay by selecting send config
                and setting to relay option. In the next step, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT Overcurrent
                room, it is enough to go to the Object Parameters test section and create the test characteristic after
                entering the information.
                Keep in mind that it is also possible to test this function using the Xrio file. Here, the current
                setting value is equal to 1 amp, TMS is 0.1. In the overcurrent test, it is required to set two
                parameters maximum torque angle and sector
                operation. To do this from the Overcurrent window and the Relay Parameters tab, the directional option
                is selected and from the Element tab, the Directional section is placed on forward. Then enter under the
                Define Element Directional
                Behavior tab and the maximum torque angle and Sector operation parameters are equal to -45 and 172
                degrees, respectively. In directional overcurrent relays, In order to better performance of relay, in
                orientation and reaching the MTA value
                ,the rotation of the reference voltage angle is used.. The performance area or forward area in this
                relay is set from -131 degrees to +41 degrees. In order to investigate the directional overcurrent
                function, in addition to the time of
                operation and current, the angle of performance should also be investigated. For this purpose,
                performance time tests are performed along with amplitude and phase tests. In the time test, the
                accuracy of the performance time is investigated
                and in the amplitude and phase test, the detection and evaluation of the accuracy of the actual current
                and the actual angle of the performance threshold and reset threshold are considered. Cross Polarized
                method is used in AMR Vebko relay,
                i.e. using healthy phases to detect fault direction. For example, in case of faults in phase A, the
                relay uses VBC reference voltage and IA current to detect the fault current direction. The Forward or
                Reverse area means the part where
                the relay must detect the fault will be determined by the start angle and end angle. Test Test In order
                to test the DOC function, three states are considered. The first state for 500 milliseconds, normal
                conditions this means that it will
                inject a nominal voltage with zero current. In the second state, the fault conditions are applied and
                the current is selected for all phases of L1E-L2E-L3E in the range of 2 to 4 times the nominal current.
                The duration of this state should
                be greater than the nominal time of the relay trip. The third state will also be activated as post-Fault
                with zero voltage and current for 500 milliseconds. In order to see better performance of the function,
                from the View menu, the Detail
                View window opens. After adding double points and four times the regulatory current at the best possible
                angle in terms of performance of the function i.e. -45 degrees for the L1E-L2E-L3E falt types, a point
                in the No Trip area here at
                an angle of 135 degrees is tested. Due to the nature of the two-phase fault, the currents in this fault
                will have a phase difference of 180 degrees so that the 3I0 current is not created and the 67N function
                is not activated. Pickup-Drop
                off Test In order to perform the Pickup-Drop off test, you can also use a relay or LED contact and even
                a setting change to instantaneous the function. For this purpose, three states are needed for example in
                the first state, the normal
                network conditions, applied, in the second state the pickup test and in the third state the drop-off
                test is performed. In the second state, for pickup and drop-off test of angle, the current value will be
                twice the regulatory current.
                these states are performed in the Overcurrent room automatically by entering the settings by the user.
                The performance range of overcurrent curves in the AMR relay starts from 1.1 regulatory current in the
                relay. Therefore, first, by enabling
                the Active Range Limits option in the Overcurrent Protection Parameters window, the Imin value is set to
                1.1 Iref. In the next step, the current adjustment value for the pickup test of the current value is
                placed on 1.1*1=1.1 amps. This
                test is performed at the best possible angle in terms of relay performance i.e. -45 degrees. After the
                current pick up-drop off, it is time to Pick up-drop off on the angle. For this purpose, as mentioned
                above, the current value is applied
                twice as much as the regulatory current, and once the trend is performed for the upper limit of the
                angle, i.e. 41 degrees, and once for the lower limit of the angle, i.e. -131 degrees. By adding the
                necessary tests and performing, you
                can finally add favorites items to the report.

            <Search>NON-DIRECTIONAL OVERCURRENT PROTECTION TEST IN AMR RELAY SIMPLE TEST USING TEMPLATES AMR modular
                relay of Vebko company supports various protection functions. Explanations of the capabilities and
                software environment of this relay have already
                been presented in the video related to differential protection test. After connecting to the AMR relay
                at first, simply load the device's hardware configuration from the Device menu by selecting the Read
                Hardware from Relay option. The
                default password is 123456 to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the signal,
                which if confirmed, if the current hardware is not the same as the relay hardware, the current hardware
                signals used in the VFC section
                are deleted. It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and current
                transformers are determined in the related card. Here the ratio of current card conversion is 200A to
                1A. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned
                earlier in the AMR software, config of some of the most widely used functions as are placed in the
                software as sample the user can send new settings to the relay by selecting each of them and applying
                the desired changes. For this purpose,
                a set of functions can be seen in the Relay VFC tab and in the Temp Functions section. It should be
                noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the blocks in the VFC are removed. Here the non-directional
                overcurrent function displayed
                under the name OC 50/51 is selected. In configuring this function, an OC Inverse block and two OC
                Definite blocks are used. They have different settings and the signals of a current card are assigned to
                their input from a measuring point.
                Finally, output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks. To
                change the settings, simply right-click on each block to access a set of options. Finally, the changes
                are sent to the relay. In this video,
                by double-clicking on blocks that contain constant time stages for non-directional overcurrent function,
                disables them and define the 1A and TMS current settings equal to 0.1 by double-clicking on the first
                stage, which is defined as reverse
                time. By making these changes, simply select Send Config and Setting to Relay from the Device menu
                again. In this way, the settings and configuration applied are moved to the relay. In the next step, by
                running AMPro software and opening
                the AMT Overcurrent room, it is enough to go to the Object Parameters test section and create the test
                characteristic after entering the information. Here, a reverse time characteristic is created by 1A and
                TMS=0.1 current settings. Keep
                in mind that it is also possible to test this characteristic using the Xrio file. In order to evaluate
                the performance of non-directional overcurrent function, two Trip Time and Pickup-Drop Off tests are
                performed. The purpose of Trip
                Time is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the performance time of this function and the purpose of
                pickup-drop off test is to detect and evaluate the accuracy of the actual current of the performance
                threshold and of reset threshold
                of this function. Trip Test Three states including PreFault, Fault and PostFault are required to perform
                this test. PreFault time is suitable for 500 milliseconds, fault time should be greater than the maximum
                trip time, and Post Fault
                time is at least 500 milliseconds. PostFault time should be increased if the drop-off is not an
                instantaneous. The suggested points for reduced time functions are 1.5 times, 2 times and 4 times the
                regulatory current, and for constant
                time curves, 1.5 and 2 times the regulatory current. To detect the regulatory current of the second
                unit, two points can be added to the amount of 90 and 110 percent of the regulatory current of the
                second unit. By adding points, perform
                the test to check the performance of this function from the point of view of time accuracy.
                Pickup/Drop-off Test In order to perform this test, first determine how the diagnosis of pickup and
                drop-off is performed. This process can be
                done through a separate contact, namely Start, Relay LED viewing, or changing the setting for
                instantaneous function and using the trip contact. Here we used the Contact Pickup Relay. You can also
                put the current fault value in the desired
                range. Here the fault value is considered 5% by default. The performance range of overcurrent curves in
                the AMR relay starts from 1.1 regulatory current in the relay. Therefore, first, by enabling the Active
                Range Limits option in the
                Overcurrent Protection Parameters window, the Imin value is set to 1.1 Iref. In the next step, the
                current setting value for the pickup is placed on 1.1*1=1.1 amps. as it is shown By adding points, it is
                enough to perform the test and
                add the necessary elements to the report when it is finished.

                supports various protection functions. Explanations of the capabilities and software environment of this
                relay have already been presented in the
                film related to differential protection test. After connecting to the AMR relay at first, simply load
                the device's hardware configuration from the Device menu by selecting the Read Hardware from Relay
                option. The default password is 123456
                in order to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the signal, which, if
                confirmed, the current hardware signals used in the VFC section will be deleted, if the current hardware
                is not the same as the relay hardware.
                It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and current transformers are
                determined in the related card. Here, the ratio of the current card conversion is 200A to 1A and the
                voltage card conversion ratio is
                63,000 to 100V. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned earlier in the AMR software, configuring some of
                the most widely used functions as examples are placed in the software and the user can send new settings
                to the relay by selecting
                each of them and applying the desired changes. For this purpose, a set of functions can be seen in the
                Relay VFC tab and in the Temp Functions section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp
                Function, the blocks in the VFC are
                removed. Here the Distance function displayed with the name Dist is selected. As can be seen in this
                Temp Function, the signals of analog relay cards are assigned to the inputs of the Distance block, as
                well as to calculate line-by-line
                voltages, voltage card signals are given to the Voltage Systems block and then assigned to the Distance
                Block. Finally, distance output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED
                blocks. You can also access
                the settings of this function by double-clicking on the Distance block. By scrolling on the signals of
                each block, more signals are displayed if available. Also visible from the Signals tab, the set of
                output signals assigned to the distance
                block. After applying the desired changes, using the Ctrl+ E combination keys or by using the File menu
                and selecting the Export XRio option, the XRio file is downloaded from the software as an output
                containing the distance function settings.
                Next, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT Distance room, simply upload the Xrio file you saved
                in the software environment in the previous step. By loading the relay distance characteristic, conduct
                the test based on the periodic
                testing system of Iran's power transmission network protection systems. Firstly, shot test is performed,
                which aims to evaluate the time of different tripe zones. The Pre Fault value is at least 1 second and
                the Post Fault value is at
                least 500 milliseconds. In order to perform this test, we place points on 80% of the value of each zone
                in line with the real axis and also in line with the angle of the line. In line with the real axis, the
                test will be performed for
                all phase-to-ground characteristics in the A-N and phase-to-phase fault loops in the B-C and ABC fault
                loops. In line angle, testing is performed for all phase-to-ground characteristics in the C-N and
                phase-to-phase fault loops in A-B
                and ABC fault loops. By performing the test, the performance time for the added points can be seen in
                different zones. In the second step, the Test Check is performed to check the performance time and range
                of the zones in the upper and
                lower part of the Rich value by drawing the lines on the R, X axes and in line with the angle of the
                line. Here, in order to avoid prolonging the test process, the check test is performed only for
                three-phase fault type. By performing
                of this test, the results of the studies will once again be visible. In the final step, search test is
                performed with the aim of searching the curve, detecting and evaluating the real range of each distance
                relay zones. For this purpose,
                search line should be selected in line with the R, X, angle of the line and the location of the
                collision of the sides. This test is performed in line with the real axis and in a way that passes
                through all zones as a one-time repetition
                for each search line, for all phase-to-ground characteristics in the A-N and phase-by-phase fault loops
                in the B-C and ABC fault loops. Here, in order to avoid prolonging the test process, this test is only
                performed for the ABC fault
                loop. In line angle and so that we cross all zones again, once repetition is performed for each line and
                for all phase-to-ground characteristics in the C-N and phase-by-phase fault loops in the A-B and ABC
                fault loops. Finally, at the
                collision site, a repeat is performed once for each search line for phase-to-ground characteristic in
                the A-N fault loop and phase to phase in the B-C fault loop. As mentioned above, in order to prevent the
                prolongation of the test process,
                these tests are only performed for the ABC fault loop. When the test is finished, you can specify the
                elements in the report and save the output in different formats such as PDF.

            <Search>DIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION TEST IN AMR RELAY SIMPLE TEST USING TEMPLATES AMR multi-function relay with
                modular and expandable hardware structure enables the development of various functions. The AMR relay
                has four regulatory groups and can save
                Event log, Trip Log and Comtrade. The relay has also successfully passed tests of protection relays in
                accordance with the IEC-60255 standard. In order to configure this relay, you can use AMR software. The
                Relay Hardware software module
                enables relay hardware configuration and Relay VFC module, allowing logic writing and implementation of
                various functions from easiest to most complex configurations. Also, using the Signal Routing module,
                functions can be implemented
                in the fastest way. After adjusting the settings, it is possible to help the relay test more easier
                through test devices by receiving the Xrio file as an output containing the functions settings. The AMR
                software can be downloaded from
                the website of The Vebko Company Vebko.org. First, the software connects to the relay using the LAN
                cable and entering the relay IP in the Communication window. After connecting to the AMR relay at first,
                simply load the hardware modules
                and the default configuration of the device by selecting the Read Hardware from Relay option. The
                default password is 123456 in order to receive elements. At this point, a message is given to remove the
                signal, which, if confirmed, the
                current hardware signals used in the VFC section will be deleted, if the current hardware is not the
                same as the relay hardware. It should be noted that the settings for the conversion ratio of voltage and
                current transformers are determined
                in the related card. Here, the ratio of the current card conversion is 200A to 1A and the voltage card
                conversion ratio is 63,000 to 100V. First, enter the VFC page: As mentioned earlier in the AMR software,
                configuring some of the most
                widely used functions as examples are placed in the software and the user can send new settings to the
                relay by selecting each of them and applying the desired changes. For this purpose, a set of functions
                can be seen in the Relay VFC
                tab and in the Temp Functions section. It should be noted that by selecting each Temp Function, the
                blocks in the VFC are removed. Here the differential function displayed with the name Diff is selected.
                In Config of this function, the
                signals of the current cards are connected to the differential block input. Finally, differential block
                output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output and LED blocks. You can access
                the settings of this function
                by double-clicking on the differential block. After applying the desired changes, using the Ctrl+ E
                combination keys or by using the File menu and selecting the Export Xrio option, the Xrio file is
                downloaded from the software as an output
                containing differential function settings. Next, by running AMPro software and opening the AMT
                Differential room, simply upload the Xrio file you saved in the software environment in the previous
                step. By loading the differential characteristic
                of the relay, conduct the test based on the periodic testing system of Iran's power transmission network
                protection systems. Here we select PreFault and Postfault time 500 milliseconds and Fault time 200
                milliseconds. Firstly, points should
                be selected within blocking and Tripping areas. The relay performance time during testing must match the
                time set in the differential relay. At each slope of the curve, test points should be established at
                least in the characteristic breakpoints
                and outside of the current tolerance and close to it and on either side of the yield curve. In the lower
                parts of the characteristic, inactivity and in the upper parts of the characteristic, the moment
                performance must be recorded. In
                order to avoid prolonging the test time, fault types L1-E, L2-L3 and L1L2L3 are selected. In the second
                step, the Check Test will be performed to calculate the performance and Inactivity on both sides of the
                characteristic, based on the
                time of the shots performed. This test is performed in fault types L1-E, L2-L3 and L1L2L3. In the next
                step, by using Search Test, we evaluate the real curve of differential protection performance. According
                to the system, in search test,
                at least two search lines should be selected on the performance curve for each part of the curve slope,
                one of these lines is better to be in the characteristic fracture area. This test is performed in fault
                types L1-E, L2-L3 and L1L2L3.
                Pickup-Drop Test As one of the functional tests, you can use pickup drop feature for differential
                characteristic. The three options Primary Side, -Secondary Side and bias allow pickup drop for
                differential component on the primary, secondary
                side as well as bias current, respectively. For this purpose, just add points for different Fault Type
                and run the test. Here, the drop-off pickup is evaluated for all types on primary and secondary sides.
                Stability test Another function
                test, is available from AMT Differential's Room Stability tab. In this section, considering Idiff=0, you
                can specify the bias value as a coefficient against the nominal current to check the trans stability in
                this case. This test is performed
                in all fault types. When the test is finished, you can specify the elements in the report and save the
                output in different formats such as PDF.

                automatically. There are two modes for transferring CSV-format files, or parameters have paths or no
                paths are defined for them. First, a CSV file is loaded from the Schneider relay, which is not defined a
                path to its blocks and parameters. In this case, all parameters are created in a block called Missing
                Parameters. This time, a CSV file is loaded from the Toshiba relay, which is defined a path to its
                blocks and parameters. In this case, there is a path for parameters, they are categorized according to
                the same default path. two important points, one is that each block's ID is made according to its name.
                Another point about parameters is that some IDs are not allowed, so IDs are checked and converted to
                authorized IDs if they are unauthorized. For this reason, the ID of a parameter may be different from
                its ID in the file, but the created Foreign ID matches the file. Type all parameters are selected from
                string type because they are not mentioned in the file.

                LEDs in the Current Output A section are turned on and after the test of each point is finished, the

                menus in the software. by using this method, blocks and parameters taken from the relay are made
                automatically. There are two modes for transferring CSV-format files, or parameters have paths or no
                paths are defined for them. First, a CSV file is loaded from the Schneider relay, which is not defined a
                path to its blocks and parameters. In this case, all parameters are created in a block called Missing
                Parameters. This time, a CSV file is loaded from the Toshiba relay, which is defined a path to its
                blocks and parameters. In this case, there is a path for parameters, they are categorized according to
                the same default path. two important points, one is that each block's ID is made according to its name.
                Another point about parameters is that some IDs are not allowed, so IDs are checked and converted to
                authorized IDs if they are unauthorized. For this reason, the ID of a parameter may be different from
                its ID in the file, but the created Foreign ID matches the file. Type all parameters are selected from
                string type because they are not mentioned in the file.
