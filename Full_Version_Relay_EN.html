distance output signals are assigned to Binary Outputs and relay LEDs by Output

<div class = "card-panel hoverable"><p class=AAE-Normal dir=LTR>Firstly, shot test is performed, which aims to
evaluate the time of different tripe zones. The Pre Fault value is at least 1

<div class = "card-panel hoverable"><p class=AAE-Normal dir=LTR>AMR multi-function relay with modular and
expandable hardware structure enables the development of various functions. The
AMR relay has four regulatory groups and can save Event log, Trip Log and
Comtrade. The relay has also successfully passed tests of protection relays in
accordance with the IEC-60255 standard.</p></div>

<div class = "card-panel hoverable"><p class=AAE-Normal dir=LTR>In order to configure this relay, you can use AMR
software. The Relay Hardware software module enables relay hardware
configuration and Relay VFC module, allowing logic writing and implementation
of various functions from easiest to most complex configurations. Also, using
the Signal Routing module, functions can be implemented in the fastest way.
After adjusting the settings, it is possible to help the relay test more easier
through test devices by receiving the Xrio file as an output containing the
functions settings. The AMR software can be downloaded from the website of The
Vebko Company (Vebko.org). First, the software connects to the relay using the
LAN cable and entering the relay IP in the Communication window.</p></div>

<div class = "card-panel hoverable"><p class=AAE-Normal dir=LTR><a name="_Hlk85053066">After connecting to the AMR
relay at first, simply load the hardware modules and the default configuration
of the device by selecting the Read Hardware from Relay option. The default
password is 123456 in order to receive elements. At this point, a message is
given to remove the signal, which, if confirmed, the current hardware signals
used in the VFC section will be deleted, if the current hardware is not the
same as the relay hardware.</a></p></div>

<div class = "card-panel hoverable"><p class=AAE-Normal dir=LTR>Firstly, points should be selected within blocking

the current tolerance and close to it and on either side of the yield curve. In
the lower parts of the characteristic, inactivity and in the upper parts of the
